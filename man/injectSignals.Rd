\usage{
injectSignals(connectionDetails, cdmDatabaseSchema, cohortDatabaseSchema,
  tablePrefix = "legend", indication = "Depression", oracleTempSchema,
  outputFolder, maxCores = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{connectionDetails}{An object of type \code{connectionDetails} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{createConnectionDetails}} function in the
DatabaseConnector package.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your patient-level data in OMOP CDM format resides.
Note that for SQL Server, this should include both the database and
schema name, for example 'cdm_data.dbo'.}

\item{cohortDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where intermediate data can be stored. You will need to have
write priviliges in this schema. Note that for SQL Server, this should
include both the database and schema name, for example 'cdm_data.dbo'.}

\item{tablePrefix}{A prefix to be used for all table names created for this study.}

\item{indication}{A string denoting the indication for which the exposure cohorts should be created.}

\item{oracleTempSchema}{Should be used in Oracle to specify a schema where the user has write
priviliges for storing temporary tables.}

\item{outputFolder}{Name of local folder to place results; make sure to use forward slashes
(/)}

\item{maxCores}{How many parallel cores should be used? If more cores are made available
this can speed up the analyses.}
