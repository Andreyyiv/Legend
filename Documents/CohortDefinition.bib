  title    = "Estimating angina prevalence in a managed care population",
  author   = "Zaher, C and Goldberg, G A and Kadlubek, P",
  abstract = "Estimations of angina prevalence were calculated using managed
              care administrative data and applying 3 angina-related
              definitions. The definitions comprised angina pectoris diagnosis
              codes, diagnosis and procedure codes signifying the broader
              condition of coronary artery disease (CAD), including angina
              pectoris, and diagnosis codes for the symptom of chest pain.
              Prevalence rates were calculated in 2000, 2001, and the combined
              period of 2000 and 2001 for each definition based on the number
              of members with at least 1 day of eligibility in each period.
              Results were compared with published estimates and projected to
              the US population. The prevalence rates per 1000 people for
              angina pectoris in 2000, 2001, and 2000--2001 were 12.3, 14.0,
              and 17.5, respectively. The prevalence rate is higher in the
              combined 2-year period primarily because there is little
              duplication in patients with angina who appear in both years, but
              there is significant overlap in the overall (denominator)
              population eligible in both years. For CAD the rates were 52.2,
              59.9, and 65.4, respectively, and for chest pain they were 63.4,
              75.8, and 93.4, respectively. Rates were higher in men versus
              women and in each successive age group. These gender and age
              results were observed in the projections to the US population. By
              comparison, the American Heart Association (AHA) estimates angina
              pectoris prevalence to be 35 per 1000 in 2001. The lower managed
              care rate for angina pectoris may reflect differences in data
              capture (ie, self-reported data for AHA vs claims submitted for
              reimbursement for managed care). AHA estimates are higher for
              women versus men while the managed care estimates show the
              opposite trend. Prevalence of angina in the United States is
              substantial. With the aging of the US population, numbers of
              patients with angina presenting to the healthcare system can be
              expected to increase, further adding to the cost burdens facing
              managed care.",

              on the development or validation of comorbidity indices using
              administrative health data and compare their ability to predict
              outcomes related to comorbidity (ie, construct validity). STUDY
              DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a comprehensive literature
              search of MEDLINE and EMBASE, until September 2012. After title
              and abstract screen, relevant articles were selected for review
              by two independent investigators. Predictive validity and model
              fit were measured using c-statistic for dichotomous outcomes and
              R(2) for continuous outcomes. RESULTS: Our review includes 76
              articles. Two categories of comorbidity indices were identified:
              those identifying comorbidities based on diagnoses, using
              International Classification of Disease codes from
              hospitalization or outpatient data, and based on medications,
              using pharmacy data. The ability of indices studied to predict
              morbidity-related outcomes ranged from poor (C statistic 0.80)
              depending on the specific index, outcome measured, and study
              population. Diagnosis-based measures, particularly the Elixhauser
              Index and the Romano adaptation of the Charlson Index, resulted
              in higher ability to predict mortality outcomes. Medication-based
              indices, such as the Chronic Disease Score, demonstrated better
              performance for predicting health care utilization. CONCLUSION: A
              number of valid comorbidity indices derived from administrative
              data are available. Selection of an appropriate index should take
              into account the type of data available, study population, and

              ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patients
              without AF. METHODS: Three US-based healthcare databases (Truven
              MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters [CCAE], Medicare
              Supplemental [MDCR], and Optum Clinformatics [Optum]) were used
              to establish patient cohorts without AF during the index period
              of 2008-2012. The performance of 2 existing models (CHADS2 and
              CHA2DS2-VASc) for predicting stroke and TIA was examined by
              fitting a logistic regression to a training dataset and
              evaluating predictive accuracy in a validation dataset (area
              under the curve, AUC) using patients with complete follow-up of 1
              or 3 years, separately. RESULTS: The commercial populations were
              younger and had fewer comorbidities than Medicare-eligible
              population. The incidence proportions of ischemic stroke and TIA
              during 1 and 3 years of follow-up were .5\% and 1.9\% (CCAE),
              .6\% and 2.2\% (Optum), and 4.6\% and 13.1\% (MDCR),
              respectively. The models performed consistently across all 3
              databases, with the AUC ranging from .69 to .77 and from .68 to
              .73 for 1- and 3-year prediction, respectively. Predictive
              accuracy was lower than the initial work of CHADS2 evaluation in
              patients with AF (AUC: .82), but consistent with a subsequent
              meta-analysis of CHADS2 (.60-.80) and CHA2DS2-VASc performance
              (.64-.79). CONCLUSION: Although the existing schemes for
              predicting ischemic stroke and TIA in patients with AF can be
              applied to patients without AF with comparable predictive
              accuracy, the evidence suggests that there is room for
              improvement in these models' performance.",

              unprecedented opportunities for biomedical discovery. Central to
              this goal is, EHR-phenotyping, also known as cohort
              identification, which remains a significant challenge. Complex
              phenotypes often require multivariate and multi-scale analyses,
              ultimately leading to manually created phenotype definitions. We
              present Ontology-driven Reports-based Phenotyping from Unique
              Signatures (ORPheUS), an automated approach to EHR-phenotyping.
              To do this we identify unique signatures of abnormal clinical
              pathology reports that correspond to pre-defined medical terms
              from biomedical ontologies. By using only the clinical pathology,
              or ``lab'', reports we are able to mitigate clinical biases
              enabling researchers to explore other dimensions of the EHR. We
              used ORPheUS to generate signatures for 858 diseases and
              validated against reference cohorts for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
              (T2DM) and Atrial Fibrillation (AF). Our results suggest that our

              source for outcomes research in patients with chronic kidney
              disease (CKD). However, in the absence of laboratory data, one
              would need to identify patients with CKD from diagnosis codes
              associated with health care claims. The validity of this approach
              to identify patients with CKD has not been sufficiently studied.
              METHODS: From chart abstraction, we obtained the first serum
              creatinine measurement of 1,852 elderly Medicare beneficiaries
              upon hospitalization for myocardial infarction and estimated each
              patient's glomerular filtration rate. We then searched all
              Medicare claims of the preceding year for the presence of a
              diagnosis code for diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive
              nephropathy, chronic renal insufficiency, acute renal failure,
              and miscellaneous other renal diseases. Using the gold standard
              of an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60
              mL/min/1.73 m2 ( or =99\%). Using combinations of these
              algorithms improved sensitivity up to 26.6\%, but at the cost of
              lower specificity. Positive predictive values generally were high
              (85.7\% to 97.5\%), but negative predictive values were low
              (32.4\% to 37.4\%). CONCLUSION: High positive predictive values
              indicate that Medicare claims data can be used to accurately
              identify patients with CKD for study. However, the utility of

              validated against the multidatabase algorithm. DESIGN: Method
              development for case ascertainment. SETTING: Three UK
              population-based electronic health record databases: the UK
              Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), the UK Hospital
              Episodes Statistics (HES) database and the UK Office of National
              Statistics (ONS) mortality database. PARTICIPANTS: 16 040 people
              over the age of 18 years with linked CPRD-HES records indicating
              potential cholestatic liver injury between 1 January 2000 and 1
              January 2013. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) The number of cases
              of cholestatic liver injury detected by the multidatabase
              algorithm. (2) The relative contribution of each data source to
              multidatabase case status. (3) The ability of the new
              single-database algorithm to discriminate multidatabase algorithm
              case status. RESULTS: Within the multidatabase case
              identification algorithm, 4033 of 16 040 potential cases (25\%)
              were identified as definite cases based on CPRD data. HES data
              allowed possible cases to be discriminated from unlikely cases
              (947 of 16 040, 6\%), but only facilitated identification of 1
              definite case. ONS data did not contribute to case definition.
              The new single-database (CPRD-only) algorithm had a very good
              ability to discriminate multidatabase case status (area under the
              receiver operator characteristic curve 0.95). CONCLUSIONS:
              CPRD-HES-ONS linkage confers minimal improvement in cholestatic
              liver injury case ascertainment compared to using CPRD data
              alone, and a multidatabase algorithm provides little additional
              information for validation of a CPRD-only algorithm. The
              availability of laboratory test results within CPRD but not HES
              means that algorithms based on CPRD-HES-linked data may not
              always be merited for studies of liver injury, or for other

              trained research assistants and residents who were blinded to the
              algorithmic diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and
              negative predictive values (PPVs, NPVs) were calculated. RESULTS:
              We obtained data from 1,920 charts from 4 different EHR systems
              (Wolf, Med Access, Nightingale, and PS Suite). For the total
              sample, sensitivity ranged from 78\% (osteoarthritis) to more
              than 95\% (diabetes, epilepsy, and parkinsonism); specificity was
              greater than 94\% for all diseases; PPV ranged from 72\%
              (dementia) to 93\% (hypertension); NPV ranged from 86\%
              (hypertension) to greater than 99\% (diabetes, dementia,
              epilepsy, and parkinsonism). CONCLUSIONS: The CPCSSN diagnostic
              algorithms showed excellent sensitivity and specificity for
              hypertension, diabetes, epilepsy, and parkinsonism and acceptable
              values for the other conditions. CPCSSN data are appropriate for
              use in public health surveillance, primary care, and health

              MEDLINE database via PubMed from 1991 to September 2012 using
              vocabulary and key terms related to uveitis. We also searched the

              regarding participant and algorithm characteristics and assessed
              a study's methodological rigor using a pre-defined approach.
              RESULTS: Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Variability exists
              among algorithms employed in these studies for finding cases of
              uveitis and related conditions as well as in use and
              implementation of validation methods. Of the seven included
              studies, three involved case validation. One used a narrow
              algorithm in addition to text mining of electronic medical
              records to identify incident cases and found a positive
              predictive value of 52.1\%. The other two, which used broader
              uveitis definitions and included both incident and prevalent
              cases, found positive predictive values of 24.8\% and 52.6\%.
              CONCLUSIONS: Further research, with case as well as individual

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common and distressing but poorly
              understood symptom among patients with heart failure (HF). This
              study sought to evaluate the prevalence, predictors, and
              prognostic value of clinically documented fatigue in newly
              diagnosed HF patients from the community. METHODS: This
              retrospective cohort study consisted of 12,285 newly diagnosed HF
              patients receiving health care services through the Geisinger
              Health System, with passive data collection through electronic
              medical records (EMR). Incident HF, fatigue, and other study
              variables were derived from coded data within EMRs. A collection
              of 87 candidate predictors were evaluated to ascertain the
              strongest independent predictors of fatigue using logistic
              regression. Patients were followed for all-cause mortality for an
              average of 4.8 years. The associations between fatigue and
              6-month, 12-month, and overall mortality were evaluated via Cox
              proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: Clinically
              documented fatigue was found in 4827 (39\%) newly diagnosed HF
              patients. Depression demonstrated the strongest association with
              fatigue. Fatigue was often part of a symptom cluster, as other HF
              symptoms including dyspnea, chest pain, edema, syncope, and
              palpitations were significant predictors of fatigue. Volume
              depletion, lower body mass index, and abnormal weight loss were
              also strong predictors of fatigue. Fatigue was not significantly
              associated with either 6-month (HR = 1.12, p = 0.16) or overall
              mortality (HR = 1.00, p = 0.89) in adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS:
              Fatigue is a commonly documented symptom among newly diagnosed HF
              patients, and its origins may lie in both psychologic and
              physiologic factors. Though fatigue did provide a prognostic
              signal in the short-term, this was largely explained by
              physiologic confounders. Proper therapeutic remediation of
              fatigue in HF relies on identifying underlying factors.",

              7500 adult patients under the care of 83 family physicians
              contributing to the Electronic Medical Record Administrative data

              predictive values for over 100 administrative data algorithms for
              RA case ascertainment. RESULTS: We identified 69 patients with RA
              for a lifetime RA prevalence of 0.9\%. All algorithms had
              excellent specificity (>97\%). However, sensitivity varied
              (75-90\%) among physician billing algorithms. Despite the low
              prevalence of RA, most algorithms had adequate positive
              predictive value (PPV; 51-83\%). The algorithm of ``[1
              hospitalization RA diagnosis code] or [3 physician RA diagnosis
              codes with >/=1 by a specialist over 2 years]'' had a sensitivity

              medical records from Geisinger Health System and healthcare
              claims data from Geisinger Health Plan. Subjects were classified
              into subgroups based on whether or not they were hospitalized for

              receipt of antibiotics) and claims-based definition (diagnosis

              value (PPV) of an algorithm to identify anaphylaxis using health
              plan administrative and claims data. Previously published PPVs
              for anaphylaxis using International Classification of Diseases,
              ninth revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes range from
              52\% to 57\%. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using
              administrative and claims data from eight health plans. Using
              diagnosis and procedure codes, we developed an algorithm to
              identify potential cases of anaphylaxis from the Mini-Sentinel
              Distributed Database between January 2009 and December 2010. A
              random sample of medical charts (n = 150) was identified for
              chart abstraction. Two physician adjudicators reviewed each
              potential case. Using physician adjudicator judgments on whether
              the case met diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis, we calculated a
              PPV for the algorithm. RESULTS: Of the 122 patients for whom
              complete charts were received, 77 were judged by physician
              adjudicators to have anaphylaxis. The PPV for the algorithm was
              63.1\% (95\%CI: 53.9-71.7\%), using the clinical criteria by
              Sampson as the gold standard. The PPV was highest for inpatient
              encounters with ICD-9-CM codes of 995.0 or 999.4. By combining
              only the top performing ICD-9-CM codes, we identified an
              algorithm with a PPV of 75.0\%, but only 66\% of cases of
              anaphylaxis were identified using this modified algorithm.
              CONCLUSIONS: The PPV for the ICD-9-CM-based algorithm for
              anaphylaxis was slightly higher than PPV estimates reported in
              prior studies, but remained low. We were able to identify an
              algorithm that optimized the PPV but demonstrated lower
              sensitivity for anaphylactic events.",

              identifying health outcomes of interest, including suicide and
              suicide attempt. METHOD: Literature was reviewed to evaluate how
              well medical episodes associated with these events could be
              identified in administrative or claims data sets from the USA or
              Canada. RESULTS: Six studies were found to include sufficient
              detail to assess performance characteristics of an algorithm on
              the basis of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
              Revision, E-codes (950-959) for intentional self-injury. Medical
              records and death registry information were used to validate
              classification. Sensitivity ranged from 13.8\% to 65\%, and
              positive predictive value range from 4.0\% to 100\%. Study
              comparisons are difficult to interpret, however, as the studies
              differed substantially in many important elements, including
              design, sample, setting, and methods. Although algorithm
              performance varied widely, two studies located in prepaid medical
              plans reported that comparisons of database codes to medical
              charts could achieve good agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient
              data exist to support specific recommendations regarding a
              preferred algorithm, and caution should be exercised in
              interpreting clinical and pharmacological epidemiological

              International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,

              against serum creatinine-based definitions of ARF in 97,705 adult
              discharges from three Boston hospitals in 2004. For ARF-D,
              ICD-9-CM codes were compared with review of medical records in
              150 patients with ARF-D and 150 control patients. As compared
              with a diagnostic standard of a 100\% change in serum creatinine,
              ICD-9-CM codes for ARF had a sensitivity of 35.4\%, specificity

              is an important caveat. The excellent performance characteristics

              involved in the design of the study, reviewed the abstracted
              medical record data and determined whether definite evidence
              supporting the diagnosis of TTP was present. The positive
              predictive value (PPV) of the claims coding algorithm for cases
              assessed by both reviewers was computed. The claims algorithm was
              further refined and the PPV of the refined algorithm was

              by two clinical experts; 86 were assessed to have definite
              evidence supporting the diagnosis of TTP (PPV 45.5\% [86/189;
              95\% confidence interval (CI), 38.3-52.9\%]). Refinement of the
              claims algorithm first included the use of plasma exchange

              findings demonstrate the difficulty of confirming the diagnosis
              of rare disorders that lack definite diagnostic criteria, and

              This retrospective observational study used the Japanese
              Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. Injuries were
              categorised into 33 groups with 5 additional groups based on
              injury sites and types. A multivariable logistic regression
              analysis was performed for in-hospital mortality in a derivation
              cohort after adjusting for the 38 groups, patient's sex, age and
              Charlson Comorbidity Index score. Each variable was assigned a
              score that was equal to the value of the regression coefficient.
              The new severity score was defined as the sum of the scores. The
              new scoring system was tested in a validation cohort. RESULTS:
              The mortality rates were 2.4\% (9270/393 395) and 2.5\% (8778/349

              heart failure (HF) in patients with HF. METHODS AND RESULTS:
              BIOSTAT-CHF is a research programme designed to develop and
              externally validate risk models to predict all-cause mortality
              and HF hospitalizations. The index cohort consisted of 2516
              patients with HF from 69 centres in 11 European countries. The
              external validation cohort consisted of 1738 comparable patients
              from six centres in Scotland, UK. Patients from the index cohort
              had a mean age of 69 years, 27\% were female, 83\% were in New
              York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III and the mean left
              ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 31\%. The full
              prediction models for mortality, hospitalization owing to HF, and
              the combined outcome, yielded c-statistic values of 0.73, 0.69,
              and 0.71, respectively. Predictors of mortality and
              hospitalization owing to HF were remarkably different. The five
              strongest predictors of mortality were more advanced age, higher
              blood urea nitrogen and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic
              peptide, lower haemoglobin, and failure to prescribe a
              beta-blocker. The five strongest predictors of hospitalization
              owing to HF were more advanced age, previous hospitalization

              clinical information availability in the administrative and
              hospital discharge records of Saskatchewan, Canada. METHODS: In
              the context of a safety cohort study, we identified
              hospitalisations with primary discharge codes 410 (2260) and 411
              (799). We selected all records with code 411, and a random sample
              (200) with code 410. Based on information obtained by trained
              abstractors from hospital records, events were classified by two
              cardiologists as definite or possible according to adapted
              AHA/ESC criteria. The validity of 410 and 411 codes was assessed
              by calculating the positive predictive value (PPV). Completeness
              of the recorded information on risk factors and use of aspirin
              was explored. RESULTS: The PPVs of the codes 410 and 411 for ACS
              were 0.96 (95\%CI: 0. 92-0.98) and 0.86 (95\%CI: 0.83-0.88),
              respectively. The PPV of 410 for acute myocardial infarction
              (AMI) was 0.95 (95\%CI: 0.91-0.98). The PPV of 411 was 0.73
              (95\%CI: 0.70-0.77) for primary unstable angina (UA) and 0.09
              (95\%CI: 0.07-0.11) for AMI. Hospital charts review revealed key
              information for clinical variables, smoking, obesity and use of
              aspirin at admission. CONCLUSIONS: ICD-9 410 code has high PPV
              for AMI cases, likewise 411 for UA cases. Case validation remains
              important in epidemiological studies with administrative health
              databases. Given the pathophysiology of ACS, both AMI and UA
              might be used as study end points. In addition to code 410, we

              We conducted a validation study in four European electronic
              health-care record (EHR) databases such as Integrated Primary
              Care Information (IPCI), Health Search/CSD Patient Database
              (HSD), ARS, and Aarhus, in which we identified UGIB cases using
              free text or disease codes: (1) International Classification of
              Disease (ICD)-9 (HSD, ARS); (2) ICD-10 (Aarhus); and (3)
              International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) (IPCI). From
              each database, we randomly selected and manually reviewed 200
              cases to calculate positive predictive values (PPVs). We employed
              different case definitions to assess the effect of outcome
              misclassification on estimation of risk of drug-related UGIB.
              RESULTS: PPV was 22\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 16, 28] and
              21\% (95\% CI: 16, 28) in IPCI for free text and ICPC codes,

              47\% (95\% CI: 35, 59) for free text in HSD. PPV for ICD-9 codes
              in ARS was 72\% (95\% CI: 65, 78) and 77\% (95\% CI: 69, 83) for

              significant impact on risk estimation of drug-related UGIB,
              except for wider CIs. CONCLUSIONS: ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 disease
              codes have good PPV in identifying UGIB from EHR; less granular
              terminology (ICPC) may require additional strategies. Use of more

              The aim of this study is to determine the ability of diagnostic
              codes and laboratory measurements to identify idiopathic ALI
              cases. METHODS: In this cross-sectional validation study,
              patients were selected from the hospital-based Utrecht Patient
              Oriented Database between 2008 and 2010. Patients were identified
              using (I) algorithms based on ICD-9-CM codes indicative of
              idiopathic ALI combined with sets of liver enzyme values (ALT >
              2x upper limit of normal (ULN); AST > 1ULN + AP > 1ULN +
              bilirubin > 1ULN; ALT > 3ULN; ALT > 3ULN + bilirubin > 2ULN; ALT
              > 10ULN) and (II) algorithms based on solely liver enzyme values
              (ALT > 3ULN + bilirubin > 2ULN; ALT > 10ULN). Hospital medical
              records were reviewed to confirm final diagnosis. The positive
              predictive value (PPV) of each algorithm was calculated. RESULTS:
              A total of 707 cases of ALI were identified. After medical review
              194 (27\%) patients had confirmed idiopathic ALI. The PPV for (I)
              algorithms with an ICD-9-CM code as well as abnormal tests ranged
              from 32\% (13/41) to 48\% (43/90) with the highest PPV found with
              ALT > 2ULN. The PPV for (II) algorithms with liver test
              abnormalities was maximally 26\% (150/571). CONCLUSIONS: The
              algorithm based on ICD-9-CM codes indicative of ALI combined with
              abnormal liver-related laboratory tests is the most efficient
              algorithm for identifying idiopathic ALI cases. However, cases
              were missed using this algorithm, because not all ALI cases had
              been assigned the relevant diagnostic codes in daily practice.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Ticagrelor increases serum adenosine concentrations,
              slowing conduction and possibly leading to bradycardia. Clinical
              trial data have shown numerically, though not statistically
              significantly, higher rates of bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor
              versus clopidogrel. Additionally, recent case reports have
              further raised concerns for this adverse effect. We explored the
              association between ticagrelor and hospitalization for
              bradycardia in a real-world setting. METHODS: We conducted a
              population-based, nested case-control study of Ontario residents,
              66 years of age or older, discharged after a first acute coronary
              syndrome by linking multiple healthcare databases. Cases included
              patients hospitalized for bradycardia within 1 year of starting a
              P2Y12 inhibitor. For each case, we identified 4 controls matched
              on age, sex, index date, and current use of a P2Y12 inhibitor.
              The exposure of interest was a prescription for ticagrelor within
              90 days, with clopidogrel use as the reference group. RESULTS:
              From April 2012 to March 2014, we identified 140 cases and 560
              controls who met the study criteria. We found no significant
              association between bradycardia and exposure to ticagrelor
              relative to clopidogrel in the previous 90 days prior to the
              index date (adjusted odds ratio 1.06, 95\% confidence interval
              0.65-2.21). Further adjustment for potential confounders also did
              not identify a significant association. CONCLUSIONS: Among older
              patients with a first acute coronary syndrome, use of ticagrelor
              was not associated with a greater risk of admission for
              bradycardia relative to clopidogrel.",

              predictive medicine. In particular, we show how emergence of
              anemia can be predicted from medical history within electronic
              health records. We used the Veterans Affairs Informatics and
              Computing Infrastructure database to examine a retrospective
              cohort of 9,738,838 veterans over an 11-year period. Using
              International Clinical Diagnoses Version 9 codes organized into
              25 major diagnostic categories, we measured progression of
              disease by examining changes in risk over time, interactions in
              risk of combination of diseases, and elevated risk associated
              with repeated hospitalization for the same diagnostic category.
              The maximum risk associated with each diagnostic category was
              used to predict anemia. The accuracy of the model was assessed
              using a validation cohort. Age and several diagnostic categories
              significantly contributed to the prediction of anemia. The
              largest contributors were health status ([Formula: see text] =
              -1075, t = -92, p < 0.000), diseases of the endocrine ([Formula:

              ([Formula: see text] = -1151, t = -89, p < 0.000). The AUC for
              the additive model was 0.751 (confidence interval
              74.95\%-75.26\%). The magnitude of AUC suggests that the model
              may assist clinicians in determining which patients are likely to
              develop anemia. The procedures used for examining changes in risk

              (TIA) using administrative data has traditionally been limited to
              reporting patients who had an acute event and were hospitalized.
              This underestimates the true prevalence because many events do
              not result in hospitalization. We examined whether the accuracy
              of administrative data for identifying prevalent stroke/TIA could
              be improved by using data from both inpatient and outpatient
              visits. METHODS: An administrative data validation reference
              standard was developed through chart abstraction of 5000 adult
              patients randomly sampled from 73,014 patients of 83 family
              physicians who participate in the Electronic Medical Record
              Administrative Data Linked Database (EMRALD), in Ontario, Canada.
              RESULTS: The prevalence of stroke/TIA in our adult population was
              3.0\%. An algorithm of 1 hospital record had a sensitivity of
              35.3\% (27.7\%-43.0\%) and specificity of 99.8\% (99.7\%-99.9\%),
              whereas an algorithm of 2 physician billings within 1 year or 1
              hospitalization had a sensitivity of 68.0\% (95\% confidence
              interval [CI], 60.5\%-75.5\%) and specificity of 98.9\% (95\% CI,
              98.6\%-99.2\%) for the identification of patients who had ever

              underestimated the prevalence of stroke by > 50\% and TIA by >
              66\% compared with using both hospitalization and physician
              claims data. CONCLUSIONS: The use of outpatient physician claims
              data in addition to hospitalization data improves the sensitivity
              of administrative data for the identification of prevalent
              stroke/TIA and may be used to estimate the prevalence of

              data for a 100\% cohort of Medicare Part A and B beneficiaries
              with >/=1 claim including a diagnosis for a form of SV (n =
              176,498), and a randomly selected group of non-SV beneficiaries
              (n = 46,561). Outcomes included annual counts of events in 16
              categories of medical services (e.g., inpatient stays, physician
              visits, tests, and imaging events), and total annual Medicare and
              patient medical expenditures. We used linear regression with
              bootstrapped standard errors to compare utilization and
              expenditures by SV status, before and after matching on age and
              sex. Prescription drug fills and expenditures for SV (n = 95,157)
              and non-SV (n = 24,992) beneficiaries with Part D drug benefits
              were also compared. RESULTS: After matching, Medicare spent
              $11,004 more per patient in 2010 for medical services, and $773
              more on prescription drugs, for SV versus non-SV beneficiaries.
              SV beneficiaries spent $1547 more for medical services and $211
              more for prescription drugs. Except for hospice, SV beneficiaries
              had greater utilization of all services, including two-to-three
              times more dialysis events, hospital readmissions, inpatient
              stays, skilled nursing facility stays, and medical tests.
              CONCLUSIONS: The average Medicare beneficiary with SV incurs
              about double the annual healthcare expenditures compared to their
              non-SV counterparts, attributable to increased utilization of
              almost all categories of care.",

              definitions for AKI have been developed, no consensus exists
              regarding which to use in children. This study applied the

              Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria to an anonymized
              cohort of hospitalizations extracted from the electronic medical
              record to compare AKI incidence and outcomes in intensive care
              unit (ICU) and non-ICU pediatric populations. DESIGN, SETTING,
              PARTICIPANTS, \& MEASUREMENTS: Observational, electronic medical
              record-enabled study of 14,795 hospitalizations at the Lucile
              Packard Children's Hospital between 2006 and 2010. AKI and AKI
              severity stage were defined by the pRIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO
              definitions according to creatinine change criteria; urine output
              criteria were not used. The incidences of AKI and each AKI stage
              were calculated for each classification system. All-cause,
              in-hospital mortality and total hospital length of stay (LOS)
              were compared at each subsequent AKI stage by Fisher exact and
              Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, respectively. RESULTS: AKI incidences
              across the cohort according to pRIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO were
              51.1\%, 37.3\%, and 40.3\%. Mortality was higher among patients
              with AKI across all definitions (pRIFLE, 2.3\%; AKIN, 2.7\%;
              KDIGO, 2.5\%; P<0.001 versus no AKI [0.8\%-1.0\%]). Within the
              ICU, pRIFLE, AKIN, and KDIGO demonstrated progressively higher
              mortality at each AKI severity stage; AKI was not associated with
              mortality outside the ICU by any definition. Both in and outside
              the ICU, AKI was associated with significantly higher LOS at each
              AKI severity stage across all three definitions (P<0.001).
              Definitions resulted in differences in diagnosis and staging of
              AKI; staging agreement ranged from 76.7\% to 92.5\%. CONCLUSIONS:
              Application of the three definitions led to differences in AKI
              incidence and staging. AKI was associated with greater mortality
              and LOS in the ICU and greater LOS outside the ICU. All three
              definitions demonstrated excellent interstage discrimination.

              which is positively correlated with the number of risk factors.
              The assessment of risk factors is essential in both stroke
              outcomes research and the surveillance of stroke burden. However,
              methods for assessment of risk factors using claims data are not
              well developed. METHODS: We enrolled 6469 patients with acute
              ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or intracerebral
              hemorrhage from hospital-based stroke registries, which were
              linked with Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) claims
              database. We developed algorithms using diagnosis codes and
              prescription data to identify stroke risk factors including
              hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation (AF),
              and coronary artery disease (CAD) in the claims database using
              registry data as reference standard. We estimated the kappa
              statistics to quantify the agreement of information on the risk
              factors between claims and registry data. RESULTS: The prevalence
              of risk factors in the registries was hypertension 77.0\%,
              diabetes 39.1\%, hyperlipidemia 55.6\%, AF 10.1\%, and CAD
              10.9\%. The highest kappa statistics were 0.552 (95\% confidence
              interval 0.528-0.577) for hypertension, 0.861 (0.836-0.885) for
              diabetes, 0.572 (0.549-0.596) for hyperlipidemia, 0.687
              (0.663-0.712) for AF, and 0.480 (0.455-0.504) for CAD. Algorithms
              based on diagnosis codes alone could achieve moderate to high
              agreement in identifying the selected risk factors, whereas
              prescription data helped improve identification of
              hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSIONS: We tested various claims-based
              algorithms to ascertain important risk factors in stroke
              patients. These validated algorithms are useful for assessing

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Population-level health administrative datasets such
              as hospital discharge data are used increasingly to evaluate
              health services and outcomes of care. However information about
              the accuracy of Australian discharge data in identifying cancer,
              associated procedures and comorbidity is limited. The Admitted
              Patients Data Collection (APDC) is a census of inpatient hospital
              discharges in the state of New South Wales (NSW). Our aim was to
              assess the accuracy of the APDC in identifying upper
              gastro-intestinal (upper GI) cancer cases, procedures for
              associated curative resection and comorbidities at the time of
              admission compared to data abstracted from medical records (the
              'gold standard'). METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 240
              patients with an incident upper GI cancer diagnosis derived from
              a clinical database in one NSW area health service from July 2006
              to June 2007. Extracted case record data was matched to APDC
              discharge data to determine sensitivity, positive predictive
              value (PPV) and agreement between the two data sources
              (kappa-coefficient). RESULTS: The accuracy of the APDC diagnostic
              codes in identifying site-specific incident cancer ranged from
              80-95\% sensitivity. This was comparable to the accuracy of APDC
              procedure codes in identifying curative resection for upper GI
              cancer. PPV ranged from 42-80\% for cancer diagnosis and 56-93\%
              for curative surgery. Agreement between the data sources was
              >0.72 for most cancer diagnoses and curative resections. However,
              APDC discharge data was less accurate in reporting common
              comorbidities - for each condition, sensitivity ranged from
              9-70\%, whilst agreement ranged from kappa = 0.64 for diabetes
              down to kappa < 0.01 for gastro-oesophageal reflux disorder.
              CONCLUSIONS: Identifying incident cases of upper GI cancer and
              curative resection from hospital administrative data is
              satisfactory but under-ascertained. Linkage of multiple
              population-health datasets is advisable to maximise case
              ascertainment and minimise false-positives. Consideration must be
              given when utilising hospital discharge data alone for generating
              comorbidity indices, as disease burden at the time of admission

              The aim was to conduct a systematic review of algorithms to
              identify CV death in administrative health plan claims databases.
              METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for
              English-language studies published between January 1, 2012 and
              October 17, 2017. We examined references in systematic reviews to
              identify earlier studies. Selection included any observational
              study using electronic health care data to evaluate the
              sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), or
              negative predictive value (NPV) of algorithms for CV death
              (sudden cardiac death [SCD], myocardial infarction [MI]-related
              death, or stroke-related death) among adults aged >/= 18 years in
              the United States. Data were extracted by two independent

              and consensus. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy
              Studies-2 instrument was used to assess the risk of bias.
              RESULTS: Five studies (n = 4 on SCD, n = 1 on MI- and
              stroke-related death) were included after a review of 2053
              citations. All studies reported algorithm PPVs, with incomplete
              reporting on other accuracy parameters. One study was at low risk
              of bias, three studies were at moderate risk of bias, and one
              study was at unclear risk of bias. Two studies identified
              community-occurring SCD: one identified events using
              International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)
              codes on death certificates and other criteria from medical
              claims (PPV = 86.8\%) and the other identified events resulting
              in hospital presentation using first-listed ICD-9 codes on
              emergency department or inpatient medical claims (PPV = 92.3\%).
              Two studies used death certificates alone to identify SCD (PPV =
              27\% and 32\%, respectively). One study used medical claims to
              identify CV death (PPV = 36.4\%), coronary heart disease
              mortality (PPV = 28.3\%), and stroke mortality (PPV = 34.5\%).
              CONCLUSION: Two existing algorithms based on medical claims
              diagnoses with or without death certificates can accurately
              identify SCD to support pharmacoepidemiologic studies. Developing
              valid algorithms identifying MI- and stroke-related death should
              be a research priority. PROSPERO 2017 CRD42017078745.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: To identify studies that have validated administrative
              and claims database algorithms for identifying patients with
              orthopedic device revision or removal. METHODS: As a part of the
              Food and Drug Administration's Mini-Sentinel pilot program, we
              performed a systematic review to identify algorithms for
              orthopedic implant removal/revision in administrative and claims
              databases in the USA or Canada. RESULTS: Five studies examined
              the validity of database algorithms against a gold standard of
              documentation in medical records (n = 3) or codes/documentation
              in another database (n = 2). The positive predictive values (PPV)
              of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
              Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and/or the Current Procedural
              Terminology codes for revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) in
              the US Medicare population compared with medical record review
              were 92\%and 91\%, respectively. In another study of the US
              Medicare population, multiple ICD-9 codes for revision total knee
              arthroplasty were compared with newly available single ICD-9-CM
              codes for revision knee arthroplasty; sensitivity was 87\% and
              specificity was 99\% (PPV not provided). The fourth study
              validated the ICD-9-CM codes for revision total knee arthroplasty
              against Ontario health insurance physician fee service claims as
              the gold standard and found a PPV of 32\%. In the last study in
              Medicare population, the accuracy of the attribution of revision
              THA to the same side as the earlier index primary THA was
              examined; PPV for same laterality of revision THA was 71\% (using
              ICD-9-CM codes). CONCLUSIONS: Validation data, with regard to the
              ICD-9-CM or the Current Procedural Terminology code algorithms
              for revision THA in the Medicare population, exist. More
              validation studies are needed to confirm these findings and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Studies investigating the risk factors for or
              causation of dementia must consider subjects prior to disease
              onset. To overcome the limitations of prospective studies and
              self-reported recall of information, the use of existing data is
              key. This review provides a narrative account of dementia
              ascertainment methods using sources of existing data. METHODS:
              The literature search was performed using: MEDLINE, EMBASE,
              PsychInfo and Web of Science. Included articles reported a
              UK-based study of dementia in which cases were ascertained using
              existing data. Existing data included that which was routinely
              collected and that which was collected for previous research.
              After removing duplicates, abstracts were screened and the
              remaining articles were included for full-text review. A quality
              tool was used to evaluate the description of the ascertainment
              methodology. RESULTS: Of the 3545 abstracts screened, 360
              articles were selected for full-text review. 47 articles were
              included for final consideration. Data sources for ascertainment
              included: death records, national datasets, research databases
              and hospital records among others. 36 articles used existing data
              alone for ascertainment, of which 27 used only a single data
              source. The most frequently used source was a research database.
              Quality scores ranged from 7/16 to 16/16. Quality scores were
              better for articles with dementia ascertainment as an outcome.
              Some papers performed validation studies of dementia
              ascertainment and most indicated that observed rates of dementia
              were lower than expected. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a lack of
              consistency in dementia ascertainment methodology using existing
              data. With no data source identified as a ``gold-standard'', we
              suggest the use of multiple sources. Where possible, studies
              should access records with evidence to confirm the diagnosis.
              Studies should also calculate the dementia ascertainment rate for
              the population being studied to enable a comparison with an
              expected rate.",

              bradycardia associated with starting immediate-release (IR) and
              slow-release (SR) formulations of metoprolol. DESIGN:
              Retrospective analysis of administrative claims data. DATA
              SOURCE: State of California Medicaid program (Medi-Cal) claims
              database. PATIENTS: A total of 31,574 adults beginning metoprolol
              between May 1, 2004, and November 1, 2009, without a pharmacy
              claim for a beta blocker within the previous 6 months of
              metoprolol initiation; patients with a primary or secondary
              diagnosis of symptomatic bradycardia, pacemaker, or implantable
              cardioverter-defibrillator placement before metoprolol initiation
              were excluded. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The study outcome
              was the time to first occurrence of emergent bradycardia,
              measured at an emergency department visit or hospitalization due
              to diagnosis of symptomatic bradycardia, after metoprolol
              initiation. We calculated the incidence and compared the risk of
              emergent bradycardia by using a proportional hazards model that
              included the metoprolol formulation with adjustment for total
              daily metoprolol dose and the use of other drugs as time-varying
              covariates, as well as demographics and comorbidities. Among
              31,574 patients starting metoprolol, 18,516 (58.6\%) used the IR
              formulation. The incidence of emergent bradycardia was 19.1/1000
              person-years overall but was nearly twice as common in patients
              using the IR versus the SR formulation (24.1/1000 person-yrs in
              the IR group versus 12.9/1000 person-yrs in the SR group,
              unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.81, 95\% confidence interval [CI]
              1.28-2.56). Adjustment for other drugs also associated with
              symptomatic bradycardia (cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitors, class I
              or III antiarrhythmics, and atrioventricular node-blocking
              agents), metoprolol dose, and other participant characteristics
              somewhat attenuated the association (adjusted HR 1.48, 95\% CI
              1.03-2.13). CONCLUSION: The risk of emergent bradycardia
              associated with metoprolol initiation was higher with the IR
              formulation than the SR formulation, although the absolute risk
              was low.",

              (ACIP) routinely recommends three vaccines - influenza, hepatitis
              B, and pneumococcal vaccines - for End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
              dialysis patients. METHODS: We sought to assess vaccination
              coverage among fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries with
              ESRD who received Part B dialysis services at any point from
              January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2015 (through June 30, 2016
              for influenza). To assess influenza vaccination rates in a given
              influenza season, we restricted the population to beneficiaries
              who were continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B
              throughout all twelve months of that season. To assess hepatitis
              B and pneumococcal vaccine coverage following dialysis
              initiation, we developed a Kaplan-Meier curve for all patients
              who began dialysis between 2006 and 2015. RESULTS: For influenza
              vaccination, we identified an average of approximately 325,000
              ESRD dialysis beneficiaries enrolled through each influenza
              season from 2006-2015. Seasonal influenza vaccination rates
              steadily increased during the 10-year period, from 52\% in
              2006-2007 to 71\% in 2015-2016. The greatest increases in
              influenza vaccination appear in non-white beneficiaries with
              overall utilization in non-whites higher than in whites (p<.001).
              For the hepatitis B and pneumococcal vaccinations, we identified
              over 350,000 ESRD dialysis beneficiaries who began dialysis over
              the 10-year study window. The probability of receiving a
              hepatitis B vaccine within the first three years of entering into
              the ESRD program was higher (77\%) than the probability of
              receiving any pneumococcal vaccine (53\%). 45\% of ESRD patients
              completed at least one dose of the two hepatitis B series
              (three-dose or four-dose) at any time during the study period.
              CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities exist at regional and facility levels
              to improve vaccination coverage. Compliance to ACIP
              recommendations may directly affect risk for ESRD dialysis

              Algorithm positive predictive values (PPVs) for various
              definitions of hypersensitivity reactions ranged from 3\% to
              95\%. PPVs were high (i.e. 90\%-95\%) when both exposures and
              diagnoses were very specific. PPV generally decreased when the
              definition of hypersensitivity was expanded, except in one study

              of access to primary care. OBJECTIVE: To analyze time trends in
              angina-related hospitalizations and seek possible explanations
              for an observed, marked decline during 1992 to 1999. RESEARCH
              DESIGN: We analyzed Medicare claims of SEER-Medicare control
              subjects for occurrence of angina hospital discharges, using the
              Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Prevention Quality
              Indicator (PQI) definition, along with occurrence of related
              events including angina admissions with revascularization, angina
              admissions discharged as coronary artery disease (CAD) or
              myocardial infarction, and overall ischemic heart disease
              discharges. SUBJECTS: Approximately 124,000 cancer-free Medicare
              beneficiary/ies, with subjects contributing data for 1 to 8
              years. RESULTS: Angina PQI hospital discharges declined 75\%
              between 1992 and 1999. CAD hospital discharges rose in a
              reciprocal pattern, while angina discharges with
              revascularization declined and discharges for myocardial
              infarction and ischemic heart disease were relatively constant
              during this time period. CONCLUSIONS: The marked decline in
              angina PQI hospital discharges during 1992-1999 does not appear
              to represent improvements in access to care or prevention of
              heart disease, but rather increased coding of more specific
              discharge diagnoses for CAD. Our findings suggest that angina
              hospitalization is not a valid measure for monitoring access to
              care and, more generally, demonstrate the need for careful,
              periodic re-evaluation of quality measures.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Consultations for chronic abdominal pain are
              frequent in adults and children. A seasonal pattern of abdominal
              pain consultations with winter predominance was shown in previous
              pediatric studies; however, no studies have investigated whether
              such a pattern exists in adult patients. Understanding the
              differences in seasonal patterns of abdominal pain consultations
              among adults and children may indicate that either different
              mechanisms exist for common chronic pain conditions or triggering
              factors may vary by age. The aim of the study was to investigate
              whether a seasonal variation in abdominal pain consultation
              patterns exists among adults and children. METHODS: The number of
              outpatient consultations among children (5-17 years) and adults
              (18 years or older) with a diagnosis of abdominal pain of
              nonspecified origin (International Classification of Diseases-9
              code 789.0) from May 2000 to December 2008 was identified in an
              administrative claims database. The primary outcome measure was
              the rate of abdominal pain consultations (total number of
              abdominal pain consultations/total number of distinct patients by
              monthx1000) by season in children and adults. Seasons were
              defined as follows: winter (December-February), spring
              (March-May), summer (June-August), and fall (September-November).
              A trend test was conducted to determine the degree of linearity
              in the patterns between the 2 groups. Among children, subanalyses
              by age 5 to 11 years and 12 to 17 years and sex were conducted.
              RESULTS: A total of 172.4 million distinct patients (13.4\%
              children, 87.6\% adults) were identified in the database between
              May 2000 and December 2008. During the same time period, 15.6
              million patient consultations for abdominal pain were identified
              (10.1\% children, 89.9\% adults). Children demonstrated a
              seasonal pattern in abdominal pain consultations, which best fit
              a quadratic regression curve, with consultations less common
              during the summer months. Abdominal pain consultations in adults
              were linear with no seasonal predominance. The trend in seasonal
              variation of abdominal pain consultations among children
              stratified by age and sex remained consistent with the overall
              child population. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal pain consultations in
              children are less common during summer months, whereas no
              evidence of seasonal pattern of consultation was found in adults.

              Information Service searches of the English language was
              performed to identify studies published between 1990 and 2010
              that evaluated the validity of algorithms for the identification
              of patients with HF using and claims data. Abstracts and articles
              were reviewed by two study investigators to determine their
              relevance on the basis of predetermined criteria. RESULTS: The
              initial search strategy identified 887 abstracts. Of these, 499
              full articles were reviewed and 35 studies included data to
              evaluate the validity of identifying patients with HF. Positive
              predictive values (PPVs) were in the acceptable to high range,
              with most being very high (>90\%). Studies that included patients
              with a primary hospital discharge diagnosis of International
              Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code 428.X had the
              highest PPV and specificity for HF. PPVs for this algorithm
              ranged from 84\% to 100\%. This algorithm, however, may
              compromise sensitivity because many HF patients are managed on an
              outpatient basis. The most common 'gold standard' for the
              validation of HF was the Framingham Heart Study criteria.
              CONCLUSIONS: The algorithms and definitions used to identify HF
              using administrative and claims data perform well, particularly
              when using a primary hospital discharge diagnosis. Attention
              should be paid to whether patients who are managed on an
              outpatient basis are included in the study sample. Including
              outpatient codes in the described algorithms would increase the
              sensitivity for identifying new cases of HF.",

              indicated for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); some
              SGLT2i have reported cardiovascular benefit, and some have
              reported risk of below-knee lower extremity (BKLE) amputation.
              This study examined the real-world comparative effectiveness
              within the SGLT2i class and compared with non-SGLT2i
              antihyperglycaemic agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 4
              large US administrative claims databases were used to
              characterize risk and provide population-level estimates of
              canagliflozin's effects on hospitalization for heart failure
              (HHF) and BKLE amputation vs other SGLT2i and non-SGLT2i in T2DM

              new-user cohort design examined relative hazards of outcomes
              across all new users and a subpopulation with established
              cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: Across the 4 databases (142 800
              new users of canagliflozin, 110 897 new users of other SGLT2i,
              460 885 new users of non-SGLT2i), the meta-analytic hazard ratio
              estimate for HHF with canagliflozin vs non-SGLT2i was 0.39 (95\%
              CI, 0.26-0.60) in the on-treatment analysis. The estimate for
              BKLE amputation with canagliflozin vs non-SGLT2i was 0.75 (95\%
              CI, 0.40-1.41) in the on-treatment analysis and 1.01 (95\% CI,
              0.93-1.10) in the intent-to-treat analysis. Effects in the
              subpopulation with established cardiovascular disease were
              similar for both outcomes. No consistent differences were
              observed between canagliflozin and other SGLT2i. CONCLUSIONS: In
              this large comprehensive analysis, canagliflozin and other SGLT2i

              between January 2000 and July 2014 that permitted assessment of

              reference such as manual chart review. In contrast to clinical
              practice, only one study used EHR-derived markers of myocardial
              necrosis to identify possible AMI cases, none used
              electrocardiogram findings and one used symptoms in the form of
              free text combined with coded diagnosis. The remaining studies
              relied mostly on coded diagnosis. Thirty one studies reported
              positive predictive value (PPV)>/= 70\% between AMI diagnosis

              Among fifteen studies reporting EHR-derived AMI phenotypes, three

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records databases are
              increasingly used for identifying cohort populations, covariates,
              or outcomes, but discerning such clinical 'phenotypes' accurately
              is an ongoing challenge. We developed a flexible method using
              overlapping (Venn diagram) queries. Here we describe this
              approach to find patients hospitalized with acute congestive
              heart failure (CHF), a sampling strategy for one-by-one 'gold
              standard' chart review, and calculation of positive predictive
              value (PPV) and sensitivities, with SEs, across different
              definitions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used retrospective queries
              of hospitalizations (2002-2011) in the Indiana Network for
              Patient Care with any CHF ICD-9 diagnoses, a primary diagnosis,
              an echocardiogram performed, a B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) drawn,
              or BNP >500 pg/mL. We used a hybrid between proportional sampling
              by Venn zone and over-sampling non-overlapping zones. The acute
              CHF (presence/absence) outcome was based on expert chart review
              using a priori criteria. RESULTS: Among 79,091 hospitalizations,
              we reviewed 908. A query for any ICD-9 code for CHF had PPV
              42.8\% (SE 1.5\%) for acute CHF and sensitivity 94.3\% (1.3\%).
              Primary diagnosis of 428 and BNP >500 pg/mL had PPV 90.4\% (SE
              2.4\%) and sensitivity 28.8\% (1.1\%). PPV was <10\% when there
              was no echocardiogram, no BNP, and no primary diagnosis. 'False
              positive' hospitalizations were for other heart disease, lung
              disease, or other reasons. CONCLUSIONS: This novel method

              aimed to derive a predictive risk model for all-cause mortality
              in type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We used primary care data from a
              large national multi-ethnic cohort of patients with type 2
              diabetes in New Zealand and linked mortality records to develop a
              predictive risk model for 5-year risk of mortality. We then
              validated this model using information from a separate cohort of
              patients with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: 26,864 people were
              included in the development cohort with a median follow up time
              of 9.1 years. We developed three models initially using
              demographic information and then progressively more clinical
              detail. The final model, which also included markers of renal

              searches of large medical record databases provide an important
              opportunity to identify a sufficient number of patients for

              However, the accuracy of CH diagnoses recorded in electronic
              health record (EHR) databases is unknown. The Research Patient
              Data Registry (RPDR) warehouses information from EHR of two
              academic medical centers in Boston. We assessed the validity of
              CH diagnoses in the RPDR as well as the sensitivity of
              International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)
              diagnostic criteria in relation to the gold standard of expert
              clinician diagnosis of CH. METHODS: In 2013, we queried RPDR to
              identify all patients diagnosed with CH diagnosed by headache
              specialists from 2002 to 2012. We sought to determine the
              positive predictive value (PPV) of an EHR diagnosis of CH
              relative to a headache expert's clinical impression as the gold
              standard. We also calculated the sensitivity of ICHD-2 CH
              criteria compared with the gold standard of expert-diagnosed CH
              cases. RESULTS: RPDR queries identified 170 patients with a
              diagnosis of CH. Two researchers carried out a detailed chart
              review searching for information to support or refute this
              diagnosis. In 58 cases, the diagnosis of CH was determined to be
              inaccurate due to data entry errors. The PPV of an RPDR diagnosis
              of CH was 63\% (95\% CI 54-71\%) and the sensitivity of ICHD-2
              criteria compared with the gold standard of expert diagnosis was
              77\% (95\% CI 69-82\%). CONCLUSIONS: The PPV of EHR diagnoses of
              CH is modest. Data entry errors are common, and only about
              three-fourths of CH cases diagnosed by expert clinicians meet
              ICHD criteria for CH. Thus, EHR searches for patients with CH
              frequently will result in false positives. This has implications
              for activities such as research, quality improvement efforts, or
              disease registries that rely on EHR searches to identify
              patients. Further work is needed to develop high quality

              and the Cochrane Library databases will be searched using
              appropriate search strategies. Studies that evaluated the
              validity of COPD codes (such as the International Classification
              of Diseases 9th Revision and 10th Revision system; the Real codes

              healthcare databases will be included. Inclusion criteria will
              be: (1) the presence of a reference standard case definition for
              COPD; (2) the presence of at least one test measure (eg,

              sepsis-associated organ dysfunction is increasing. We examined
              whether coding practices for acute organ dysfunction are changing
              over time and if so, whether this is biasing estimates of rising
              severe sepsis incidence and severity. METHODS: We assessed trends
              from 2005 to 2013 in the annual sensitivity and incidence of
              discharge ICD-9-CM codes for organ dysfunction (shock,
              respiratory failure, acute kidney failure, acidosis, hepatitis,
              coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia) relative to standardized
              clinical criteria (use of vasopressors/inotropes, mechanical
              ventilation for >/= 2 consecutive days, rise in baseline
              creatinine, low pH, elevated transaminases or bilirubin, abnormal
              international normalized ratio or low fibrinogen, and decline in
              platelets). We studied all adult patients with suspected
              infection (defined by >/= 1 blood culture order) at two US
              academic hospitals. RESULTS: Acute organ dysfunction codes were
              present in 57,273 of 191,695 (29.9\%) hospitalizations with
              suspected infection, most commonly acute kidney failure (60.2\%
              of cases) and respiratory failure (28.9\%). The sensitivity of
              all organ dysfunction codes except thrombocytopenia increased
              significantly over time. This was most pronounced for acute
              kidney failure codes, which increased in sensitivity from 59.3\%
              in 2005 to 87.5\% in 2013 relative to a fixed definition for
              changes in creatinine (p = 0.019 for linear trend). Acute kidney
              failure codes were increasingly assigned to patients with smaller
              creatinine changes: the average peak creatinine change associated
              with a code was 1.99 mg/dL in 2005 versus 1.49 mg/dL in 2013 (p
              <0.001 for linear decline). The mean number of dysfunctional
              organs in patients with suspected infection increased from 0.32
              to 0.59 using discharge codes versus 0.69 to 0.79 using clinical
              criteria (p < 0.001 for both trends and comparison of the two
              trends). The annual incidence of hospitalizations with suspected
              infection and any dysfunctional organ rose an average of 5.9\%
              per year (95\% CI 4.3, 7.4\%) using discharge codes versus only
              1.1\% (95\% CI 0.1, 2.0 \%) using clinical criteria. CONCLUSIONS:
              Coding for acute organ dysfunction is becoming increasingly
              sensitive and the clinical threshold to code patients for certain
              kinds of organ dysfunction is decreasing. This accounts for much

              incidence of sepsis is increasing and mortality rates from sepsis
              are decreasing. However, estimates from claims data may lack
              clinical fidelity and can be affected by changing diagnosis and
              coding practices over time. Objective: To estimate the US
              national incidence of sepsis and trends using detailed clinical
              data from the electronic health record (EHR) systems of diverse
              hospitals. Design, Setting, and Population: Retrospective cohort
              study of adult patients admitted to 409 academic, community, and
              federal hospitals from 2009-2014. Exposures: Sepsis was
              identified using clinical indicators of presumed infection and
              concurrent acute organ dysfunction, adapting Third International
              Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)
              criteria for objective and consistent EHR-based surveillance.
              Main Outcomes and Measures: Sepsis incidence, outcomes, and
              trends from 2009-2014 were calculated using regression models and
              compared with claims-based estimates using International
              Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
              codes for severe sepsis or septic shock. Case-finding criteria
              were validated against Sepsis-3 criteria using medical record
              reviews. Results: A total of 173690 sepsis cases (mean age, 66.5
              [SD, 15.5] y; 77660 [42.4\%] women) were identified using
              clinical criteria among 2901019 adults admitted to study
              hospitals in 2014 (6.0\% incidence). Of these, 26061 (15.0\%)
              died in the hospital and 10731 (6.2\%) were discharged to
              hospice. From 2009-2014, sepsis incidence using clinical criteria
              was stable (+0.6\% relative change/y [95\% CI, -2.3\% to 3.5\%],
              P = .67) whereas incidence per claims increased (+10.3\%/y [95\%
              CI, 7.2\% to 13.3\%], P < .001). In-hospital mortality using
              clinical criteria declined (-3.3\%/y [95\% CI, -5.6\% to -1.0\%],
              P = .004), but there was no significant change in the combined
              outcome of death or discharge to hospice (-1.3\%/y [95\% CI,
              -3.2\% to 0.6\%], P = .19). In contrast, mortality using claims
              declined significantly (-7.0\%/y [95\% CI, -8.8\% to -5.2\%], P <
              .001), as did death or discharge to hospice (-4.5\%/y [95\% CI,
              -6.1\% to -2.8\%], P < .001). Clinical criteria were more
              sensitive in identifying sepsis than claims (69.7\% [95\% CI,
              52.9\% to 92.0\%] vs 32.3\% [95\% CI, 24.4\% to 43.0\%], P <
              .001), with comparable positive predictive value (70.4\% [95\%
              CI, 64.0\% to 76.8\%] vs 75.2\% [95\% CI, 69.8\% to 80.6\%], P =
              .23). Conclusions and Relevance: In clinical data from 409
              hospitals, sepsis was present in 6\% of adult hospitalizations,
              and in contrast to claims-based analyses, neither the incidence
              of sepsis nor the combined outcome of death or discharge to
              hospice changed significantly between 2009-2014. The findings
              also suggest that EHR-based clinical data provide more objective
              estimates than claims-based data for sepsis surveillance.",

              searches were performed by Doctor Evidence, a global medical
              evidence software and services company, across PubMed and EMBASE

              traditional frequentist statistical and Bayesian approaches,
              including random-effects Bayesian network meta-analyses. RESULTS:
              Our results suggest that: 1) There is a modest but significant
              improvement in systolic BP in randomized controlled trials of
              self-measured BP versus usual care at 6 but not 12 months, and
              for selected patients and their providers self-measured BP may be
              a helpful adjunct to routine office care. 2) systolic BP lowering
              to a target of <130 mm Hg may reduce the risk of several
              important outcomes including risk of myocardial infarction,
              stroke, heart failure, and major cardiovascular events. No class

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Diagnosis is complex, uncertain, and error-prone.
              Symptoms such as nonspecific abdominal pain are especially
              challenging. A diagnostic path consists of diagnostic steps taken
              from initial presentation until a diagnosis is obtained or the
              evaluation ends for other reasons. Analysis of diagnostic paths
              can reveal patterns associated with more timely and accurate
              diagnosis. Visual analytics can be used to enhance both analysis
              and comprehension of diagnostic paths. OBJECTIVE: This article
              applies process-mining methods to extract and visualize
              diagnostic paths from electronic health records (EHRs). METHODS:
              Patient features, actions taken (i.e., tests, referrals, etc.),
              and diagnoses obtained for 501 adult patients (half female, half
              >/=50 years of age) presenting with abdominal pain were extracted
              from an EHR database to construct diagnostic paths from a
              hospital system in suburban Chicago, Illinois, United States. A
              stable diagnosis was defined as the same diagnosis recorded twice
              in a 12-month period; a working diagnosis was recorded only once.
              Three different types of path visualizations were obtained.
              RESULTS: A stable diagnosis was obtained in 63 (13\%) patients
              after 12 months. In 271 (54\%) patients, a working diagnosis was
              obtained. Mean path duration was 145.3 days (standard deviation,
              195.1 days). These 63 patients received 75 stable diagnoses.
              CONCLUSION: Structured EHR data can be used to construct
              diagnostic paths to gain insight into diagnostic practices for
              complaints such as abdominal pain.",

              identify patients with heart failure (HF). OBJECTIVE: To
              systematically review studies that assessed the validity of
              administrative data for recording HF. METHODS: English
              peer-reviewed articles (1990 to 2008) validating International
              Classification of Diseases (ICD)-8, -9 and -10 codes from
              administrative data were included. An expert panel determined
              which ICD codes should be included to define HF. Frequencies of
              ICD codes for HF were calculated using up to the 16 diagnostic
              coding fields available in the Canadian hospital discharge
              abstract during fiscal years 20002001 and 20052006. RESULTS:
              Between 1992 and 2008, more than 70 different ICD codes for
              defining HF were used in 25 published studies. Twenty-one studies
              validated hospital discharge abstract data; three studies
              validated physician claims and two studies validated ambulatory
              care data. Eighteen studies reported sensitivity (range 29\% to
              89\%). Specificity and negative predictive value were greater
              than 70\% across 17 studies. Nineteen studies reported positive
              predictive values (range 12\% to 100\%). Ten studies reported
              kappa values (range 0.39 to 0.84). For Canadian hospital
              discharge data, ICD-9 and -10 codes 428 and I50 identified HF in
              5.50\% and 4.80\% of discharge records, respectively. Additional
              HF-related ICD-9 and -10 codes did not impact HF prevalence.
              CONCLUSION: The ICD-9 and -10 codes 428 and I50 were the most
              commonly used to define HF in hospital discharge data. Validity

              Cohort study on the risk of UGIC in users of nonsteroidal
              anti-inflammatory drugs conducted in Friuli Venezia Giulia

              Clinical specific codes 531 (gastric ulcer), 532 (duodenal

              nonspecific code 578 (gastrointestinal hemorrhage). Potential
              cases were confirmed through hospital chart review. RESULTS: The
              chart retrieval percentage was 98.4\%.The positive predictive
              value (PPV) was 94.3\% for primary codes 531 and 532, 79.5\% for
              code 533, 83.1\% for code 534, 40.2\% for code 578. The PPV for
              secondary codes was 34.7\% but increased to 88.9\% and 79.2\%
              when the primary code was for peritonitis or acute
              post-hemorrhagic anemia, respectively. Validation of secondary
              codes increased case ascertainment by 4.9\%. Endoscopy confirmed
              79.4\% of cases but only 67.2\% of those above age 84 years.
              CONCLUSIONS: The PPV was high for specific primary codes and
              moderate to low for nonspecific primary and secondary codes. The
              inclusion of confirmed cases identified by nonspecific and
              secondary codes can be of value in studies that need a complete
              ascertainment of cases occurring in the study population. In this

              statewide hospital discharge file (HDF) to enhance central cancer
              registry reporting. Incident cancers from a Virginia cancer
              registry were linked with an HDF for 1995. Medical record
              abstractions for over 2,000 cancers verified HDF and registry
              data. There were 19,740 unique cases ascertained from the two
              combined data sources. The registry captured approximately 83\%
              of cases, while the HDF captured 62\%. Although the HDF missed a
              substantial number of registry cases, the HDF positive predictive
              value for identifying the correct cancer site was 94\%. Logistic
              regression was used to identify significant characteristics of

              high rates of E-coding completeness: 1999-2001 British Columbia,
              Canada data and the 2004 US Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Our gold
              standard for intentional self-harm was a diagnosis of E950-E958.
              We constructed algorithms to identify these hospitalizations
              using information on type of injury and presence of specific
              psychiatric diagnoses. RESULTS: The algorithm that identified
              intentional self-harm hospitalizations with high sensitivity and
              specificity was a diagnosis of poisoning, toxic effects, open
              wound to elbow, wrist, or forearm, or asphyxiation; plus a
              diagnosis of depression, mania, personality disorder, psychotic
              disorder, or adjustment reaction. This had a sensitivity of 63\%,
              specificity of 99\% and positive predictive value (PPV) of 86\%
              in the Canadian database. Values in the US data were 74, 98, and
              73\%. PPV was highest (80\%) in patients under 25 and lowest
              those over 65 (44\%). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed algorithm may be
              useful for researchers attempting to study intentional self-harm
              in claims databases with incomplete E-code reporting, especially
              among younger populations.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: The identification of upper gastrointestinal (UGI)
              bleeding and perforated ulcers in claims data typically relies on
              inpatient diagnoses. The use of hemoglobin laboratory results
              might increase the detection of UGI events that do not lead to
              hospitalization. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to evaluate
              whether hemoglobin results increase UGI outcome identification in
              electronic databases, using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
              (NSAIDs) as a test case. METHODS: From three data partner sites
              within the Mini-Sentinel Distributed Database, we identified
              NSAID initiators aged >/=18 years between 2008 and 2013. Numbers
              of events and risks within 30 days after NSAID initiation were
              calculated for four mutually exclusive outcomes: (1) inpatient
              UGI diagnosis of bleeding or gastric ulcer (standard claims-based
              definition without laboratory results); (2) non-inpatient UGI
              diagnosis AND >/=3 g/dl hemoglobin decrease; (3) >/=3 g/dl
              hemoglobin decrease without UGI diagnosis in any clinical
              setting; (4) non-inpatient UGI diagnosis, without >/=3 g/dl
              hemoglobin decrease. RESULTS: We identified 2,289,772 NSAID
              initiators across three sites. Overall, 45.3\% had one or more
              hemoglobin result available within 365 days before or 30 days
              after NSAID initiation; only 6.8\% had results before and after.
              Of 7637 potential outcomes identified, outcome 1 accounted for
              21.7\%, outcome 2 for 0.8\%, outcome 3 for 34.3\%, and outcome 4
              for 43.3\%. Potential cases identified by outcome 3 were largely
              not suggestive of UGI events. Outcomes 1, 2, and 4 had similar
              distributions of specific UGI diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Using
              available hemoglobin result values combined with non-inpatient
              UGI diagnoses identified few additional UGI cases. Non-inpatient
              UGI diagnostic codes may increase outcome detection but would

              (HFpEF) comprises nearly half of prevalent HF, yet is challenging
              to curate in a large database of electronic medical records (EMR)
              since it requires both accurate HF diagnosis and left ventricular
              ejection fraction (EF) values to be consistently >/=50\%.
              METHODS: We used the national Veterans Affairs EMR to curate a
              cohort of HFpEF patients from 2002 to 2014. EF values were
              extracted from clinical documents utilizing natural language
              processing and an iterative approach was used to refine the
              algorithm for verification of clinical HFpEF. The final algorithm
              utilized the following inclusion criteria: any International
              Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) code of HF (428.xx); all
              recorded EF >/=50\%; and either B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)
              or aminoterminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) values recorded OR diuretic
              use within one month of diagnosis of HF. Validation of the
              algorithm was performed by 3 independent reviewers doing manual
              chart review of 100 HFpEF cases and 100 controls. RESULTS: We
              established a HFpEF cohort of 80,248 patients (out of a total
              1,155,376 patients with the ICD-9 diagnosis of HF). Mean age was
              72 years; 96\% were males and 12\% were African-Americans.
              Validation analysis of the HFpEF algorithm had a sensitivity of
              88\%, specificity of 96\%, positive predictive value of 96\%, and
              a negative predictive value of 87\% to identify HFpEF cases.
              CONCLUSION: We developed a sensitive, highly specific algorithm
              for detecting HFpEF in a large national database. This approach
              may be applicable to other large EMR databases to identify HFpEF

              Health Insurance (NHI) system can be useful in stroke research.
              The aim of this study was to validate the accuracy of hospital
              discharge data used for NHI claims in identifying acute stroke
              and use of thrombolytic therapy. METHODS: The hospital discharge
              data of 1,811 patients with stroke-related diagnosis codes were
              obtained from Jeju National University Hospital (JNUH) and Seoul
              Medical Center (SMC). Three algorithms were tested to identify
              discharges with acute stroke [ischemic stroke (IS), intracranial
              hemorrhage (ICH), or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)]: 1) all
              diagnosis codes up to nine positions, 2) one primary diagnosis
              and one secondary diagnosis, and 3) only one primary diagnosis
              code. Reviews of medical records were considered the gold
              standards. RESULTS: Overall, the degree of agreement (kappa) was
              higher for algorithms 1 and 2 than for algorithm 3, and the
              sensitivity and specificity of the first two algorithms for IS
              and SAH were both >90\%, with almost perfect agreement
              (kappa=0.83-0.84) in the JNUH data set. Regarding ICH, only
              algorithm 1 yielded an almost perfect agreement (kappa=0.82). In
              the SMC data set, almost perfect agreement was found for both ICH
              and SAH in all three algorithms. In contrast, the three
              algorithms yielded a range of agreement levels, though all
              substantial, for IS. Almost perfect agreement was obtained for
              use of thrombolytic therapy in both data sets (kappa=0.91-0.99).
              CONCLUSIONS: Discharge with hemorrhagic stroke and use of
              thrombolytic therapy were identified with high reliability in
              administrative discharge data. A substantial level of agreement

              within a 2-year period or 1 hospital discharge abstract record.
              METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
              Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched
              MEDLINE (from 1946) and EMBASE (from 1947) for relevant studies
              through September 2016 (keywords: ``hypertension,''

              differing reference standards and study populations; thus, we
              considered each separately. The quality scores of the retained
              studies ranged from 10-12 of a maximum 14. The sensitivity of the
              definition investigated to identify hypertension using

              causes of differences in DILI case definitions provided by two
              institutions-Columbia University and Mayo Clinic; harmonized two
              EHR phenotyping algorithms; and assessed the performance,
              measured by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,
              and negative predictive value, of the resulting algorithm at
              three institutions except that sensitivity was measured only at
              Columbia University. RESULTS: Although these sites had the same
              case definition, their phenotyping methods differed by selection
              of liver injury diagnoses, inclusion of drugs cited in DILI
              cases, laboratory tests assessed, laboratory thresholds for liver
              injury, exclusion criteria, and approaches to validating
              phenotypes. We reached consensus on a DILI phenotyping algorithm
              and implemented it at three institutions. The algorithm was
              adapted locally to account for differences in populations and
              data access. Implementations collectively yielded 117
              algorithm-selected cases and 23 confirmed true positive cases.
              DISCUSSION: Phenotyping for rare conditions benefits
              significantly from pooling data across institutions. Despite the
              heterogeneity of EHRs and varied algorithm implementations, we
              demonstrated the portability of this algorithm across three
              institutions. The performance of this algorithm for identifying
              DILI was comparable with other computerized approaches to
              identify adverse drug events. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotyping algorithms
              developed for rare and complex conditions are likely to require
              adaptive implementation at multiple institutions. Better
              approaches are also needed to share algorithms. Early agreement

              portability of the algorithms.",

              researchers will not have access to death information in the
              enrollment files. We developed and evaluated a claims-based
              definition of death. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used
              healthcare claims and enrollment data between January 2005 and
              August 2009 for 195,193 beneficiaries aged 20 to 74 in 3 private
              health insurance unions. We developed claims-based definitions of
              death using discharge or disease status and Charlson comorbidity
              index (CCI). We calculated sensitivity, specificity and positive
              predictive values (PPVs) using the enrollment data as a gold
              standard in the overall population and subgroups divided by
              demographic and other factors. We also assessed bias and
              precision in two example studies where an outcome was death. The
              definition based on the combination of discharge/disease status
              and CCI provided moderate sensitivity (around 60\%) and high
              specificity (99.99\%) and high PPVs (94.8\%). In most subgroups,
              sensitivity of the preferred definition was also around 60\% but
              varied from 28 to 91\%. In an example study comparing death rates
              between two anticancer drug classes, the claims-based definition
              provided valid and precise hazard ratios (HRs). In another
              example study comparing two classes of anti-depressants, the HR
              with the claims-based definition was biased and had lower
              precision than that with the gold standard definition.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The claims-based definitions of death
              developed in this study had high specificity and PPVs while
              sensitivity was around 60\%. The definitions will be useful in
              future studies when used with attention to the possible
              fluctuation of sensitivity in some subpopulations.",

              claims data, using tumor stage from an oncology electronic
              medical record (EMR) data warehouse as the gold standard.
              METHODS: Data from an outpatient oncology EMR database were
              linked to medical and pharmacy claims data. Patients diagnosed
              with breast, lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer with a stage
              recorded in the EMR between 2004 and 2010 and with medical claims
              available were eligible for the study. Separate algorithms were
              developed for each tumor type using variables from the claims,
              including diagnoses, procedures, drugs, and oncologist visits.
              Candidate variables were reviewed by two oncologists. For each
              tumor type, the selected variables were entered into a
              classification and regression tree model to determine the
              algorithm with the best combination of positive predictive value
              (PPV), sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS: A total of 1385
              breast cancer, 1036 lung, 727 colorectal, and 267 prostate cancer
              patients qualified for the analysis. The algorithms varied by
              tumor type but typically included International Classification of
              Diseases-Ninth Revision codes for secondary neoplasms and use of
              chemotherapy and other agents typically given for metastatic
              disease. The final models had PPV ranging from 0.75 to 0.86,
              specificity 0.75-0.97, and sensitivity 0.60-0.81. CONCLUSIONS:
              While most of these algorithms for metastatic cancer had good
              specificity and acceptable PPV, a tradeoff with sensitivity
              prevented any model from having good predictive ability on all
              measures. Results suggest that accurate ascertainment of
              metastatic status may require access to medical records or other

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Despite the use of administrative data to
              perform epidemiological and cost-effectiveness research on
              patients with hepatitis B or C virus (HBV, HCV), there are no
              data outside of the Veterans Health Administration validating
              whether International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision,
              Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes can accurately identify
              cirrhotic patients with HBV or HCV. The validation of such
              algorithms is necessary for future epidemiological studies.
              METHODS: We evaluated the positive predictive value (PPV) of
              ICD-9-CM codes for identifying chronic HBV or HCV among cirrhotic
              patients within the University of Pennsylvania Health System, a
              large network that includes a tertiary care referral center, a
              community-based hospital, and multiple outpatient practices
              across southeastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey. We
              reviewed a random sample of 200 cirrhotic patients with ICD-9-CM
              codes for HCV and 150 cirrhotic patients with ICD-9-CM codes for
              HBV. RESULTS: The PPV of 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient HCV codes
              was 88.0\% (168/191, 95\% CI: 82.5-92.2\%), while the PPV of 1
              inpatient or 2 outpatient HBV codes was 81.3\% (113/139, 95\% CI:
              73.8-87.4\%). Several variations of the primary coding algorithm
              were evaluated to determine if different combinations of
              inpatient and/or outpatient ICD-9-CM codes could increase the PPV
              of the coding algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: ICD-9-CM codes can identify
              chronic HBV or HCV in cirrhotic patients with a high PPV and can
              be used in future epidemiologic studies to examine disease burden

              identifying atrial fibrillation (AF) patients and stroke risk
              using electronic data for use in performance measures. METHODS:
              Patients with AF seen in clinic were identified based on
              International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision(ICD-9)
              codes. CHADS(2) and CHA(2)DS(s)-Vasc scores were derived from a
              broad, 10-year algorithm using IICD-9 codes dating back 10 years
              and a restrictive, 1-year algorithm that required a diagnosis
              within the past year. Accuracy of claims-based AF diagnoses and
              of each stroke risk classification algorithm were evaluated using
              chart reviews for 300 patients. These algorithms were applied to
              assess system-wide anticoagulation rates. RESULTS: Between
              6/1/2011, and 5/31/2012, we identified 6,397 patients with AF.
              Chart reviews confirmed AF or atrial flutter in 95.7\%. A 1-year
              algorithm using CHA(2)DS(2)-Vasc score >/=2 to identify patients
              at risk for stroke maximized positive predictive value (97.5\%
              [negative predictive value 65.1\%]). The PPV of the 10-year
              algorithm using CHADS(2) was 88.0\%; 12\% those identified as
              high-risk had CHADS(2) scores /=2 (58.5\% on anticoagulation) and
              CHA(2)DS(2)-Vasc scores >/=2 (56.0\% on anticoagulation).
              CONCLUSIONS: Automated methods can be used to identify patients
              with prevalent AF indicated for anticoagulation but may have
              misclassification up to 12\%, which limits the utility of relying
              on administrative data alone for quality assessment.
              Misclassification is minimized by requiring comorbidity diagnoses
              within the prior year and using a CHA(2)DS(2)-Vasc based
              algorithm. Despite differences in accuracy between algorithms,
              system-wide anticoagulation rates assessed were similar

              using laboratory measurements versus claims data from 6,982
              REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke)
              Study participants who had Medicare fee-for-service coverage.
              PREDICTORS: Presence of CKD as defined by both the REGARDS Study
              (CKDREGARDS) and Medicare data (CKDMedicare), presence of
              CKDREGARDS but not CKDMedicare, and presence of CKDMedicare but
              not CKDREGARDS, and absence of both CKDREGARDS and CKDMedicare.
              OUTCOMES: Mortality and incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
              MEASUREMENTS: The research study definition of CKD (CKDREGARDS)
              included estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30mg/g at
              the REGARDS Study visit. CKD in Medicare (CKDMedicare) was

              specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of
              CKDMedicare for identifying CKDREGARDS were 15.5\% (95\% CI,

              1,000 person-years, were higher for participants with versus

              0.0-0.3]). Among participants with CKDREGARDS, those with
              abdominal obesity, diabetes, anemia, lower eGFR, more outpatient
              visits, hospitalization, and a nephrologist visit in the 2 years
              before their REGARDS visit were more likely to have CKDMedicare.
              LIMITATIONS: CKDREGARDS relied on eGFR and albuminuria assessed
              at a single visit. CONCLUSIONS: CKD, whether defined in claims or
              through research study measurements, was associated with

  abstract = "AIMS: With self-reporting of erectile dysfunction (ED) in
              population-based surveys, men with ED may not represent men who
              are bothered sufficiently to seek an ED diagnosis and treatment.
              We used real-world observational data to assess: 1) the
              prevalence of ED diagnosis or treatment by age subgroups; and 2)
              the relationship of age with ED diagnosis or treatment after
              controlling for ED-related comorbidities in the USA. METHODS:
              This cross-sectional study used de-identified claims data
              (MarketScan((R)) databases; primary analysis). Sensitivity
              analysis was conducted using electronic health records
              (Humedica((R)) database). Inclusion criteria were men aged >/=18
              years with a 360-day continuous enrollment before the index date.
              We assessed the prevalence of ED diagnosis or phosphodiesterase
              type 5 inhibitor (PDE5I) prescription by age and the risk for ED
              diagnosis or treatment by age after controlling for comorbidities
              (hypertension, other cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus,
              depression and benign prostatic hyperplasia). RESULTS: Of
              19,833,939 men meeting inclusion criteria in the primary
              analysis, only 1 108 842 (5.6\%) had an ED diagnosis or PDE5I
              prescription (mean [SD] age: 55.2 [11.2] years). Prevalence of ED
              diagnosis or treatment increased from age 18-29 years (0.4\%) to
              60-69 years (11.5\%), then decreased in the seventh (11.0\%),
              eighth (4.6\%), and ninth (0.9\%) decades. Men with ED diagnosis
              or treatment had a higher prevalence of any comorbidity (63.1\%
              vs 29.3\% for men without ED) and of each comorbid condition. In
              multivariate analyses, age was an independent risk factor for ED
              diagnosis or treatment. Sensitivity analysis provided consistent
              results. CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting in the USA, the
              prevalence of ED diagnosis or PDE5I treatment is generally low,
              increases with age, decreases in very old men, and is associated
              with increased prevalence of comorbidities. Age is an independent

              identify patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in

              MEDLINE database from 1991 to September 2012 using controlled
              vocabulary and key terms related to SLE. We also searched the
              reference lists of included studies. Two investigators
              independently assessed the full text of studies against
              pre-determined inclusion criteria. The two reviewers
              independently extracted data regarding participant and algorithm
              characteristics and assessed a study's methodologic rigor using a
              pre-defined approach. RESULTS: Twelve studies included validation
              statistics for the identification of SLE in administrative and
              claims databases. Seven of these studies used the ICD-9 code of
              710.0 in selected populations of patients seen by a
              rheumatologist or patients who had experienced the complication
              of SLE-associated nephritis, other kidney disease, or pregnancy.
              The other studies looked at limited data in general populations.
              The algorithm in the selected populations had a positive
              predictive value (PPV) in the range of 70-90\% and of the limited
              data in general populations it was in the range of 50-60\%.
              CONCLUSIONS: Few studies use rigorous methods to validate an
              algorithm for the identification of SLE in general populations.
              Algorithms including ICD-9 code of 710.0 in physician billing and
              hospitalization records have a PPV of approximately 60\%. A
              requirement that the code is obtained from a record based on
              treatment by a rheumatologist increases the PPV of the algorithm
              but limits the generalizability in the general population.",

              algorithm for identifying patient populations with sickle cell
              disease. METHODS: In this retrospective study we used electronic
              health record data from the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin to
              develop a computable phenotype algorithm for sickle cell disease.
              The algorithm was on the basis of the International
              Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes, number of
              visits, and hospital admissions for sickle cell disease. Using
              Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside queries, the
              algorithm was refined in an iterative process. The final
              algorithm was verified using manual medical records review and by
              comparison with a gold standard set of confirmed sickle cell
              cases. The algorithm was then validated at Froedtert Hospital, a
              neighboring health system for adults. RESULTS: From the
              Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, our computable phenotype
              algorithm identified patients with confirmed sickle cell disease
              with a positive predictive value of 99.4\% and a sensitivity of
              99.4\%. Additionally, using data from Froedtert, the computable
              phenotype algorithm identified patients with confirmed sickle
              cell disease with a positive predictive value of 95.8\% and a
              sensitivity of 98.3\%. CONCLUSIONS: The computable phenotype

              ED. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective US
              claims data analysis (1999-2004) evaluating men > or = 40 years
              old with a new diagnosis of or prescription medication for ED.
              Multivariate analyses were used to examine times to screening,
              diagnosis, and treatment. RESULTS: 81 659 men with ED were
              identified (mean age 57 years). The baseline prevalence of
              recorded BPH was 1.5\%. During the follow-up period (mean 2.2
              years), 7.6\% had documented BPH. Time to screening was shorter
              among patients seeing urologists (121.1 days) compared with those
              seeing primary-care physicians (282.2 days). Controlling for
              demographic and clinical characteristics, patients who saw a
              urologist were more likely to be screened (OR: 2.4, p < 0.0001),
              diagnosed with BPH (OR: 1.8, p < 0.0001), and treated (OR: 1.3, p
              < 0.0001), relative to patients seeing other providers. Men aged
              75 and over were 43\% less likely to be screened (p < 0.0001),
              but 5.4 times more likely to be diagnosed with BPH (p < 0.0001)
              and 5.3 times more likely to be treated (p < 0.0001) compared
              with men aged 40-49. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for BPH appears less
              likely for men with ED who do not see a urologist. When screening
              does occur, it takes much longer with non-specialty providers.
              Patient age and provider specialty are key factors associated
              with screening, diagnosis, and treatment of BPH among men with

              METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching the
              MEDLINE/EMBASE databases from inception to June 2018,
              hand-searching reference lists, and consulting experts. The
              search strategy included synonyms for ``Dementia'', ``Europe'',
              and ``EHR''. Studies were included if they validated dementia
              diagnoses in UK primary care or hospitalisation databases,
              irrespective of validation method used. The Quality Assessment
              for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to
              assess risk of bias. RESULTS: From 1469 unique records, 14
              relevant studies were included. Thirteen validated individual
              diagnoses against a reference standard, reporting high estimates
              of validity. Most reported only the positive predictive value
              (PPV), with estimates ranging between 0.09 and 1.0 and 0.62 and
              0.85 in primary care and hospitalisation databases, respectively.

              heterogenous across studies, reported validity estimates were
              generally high. However, the credibility of these estimates is
              limited by the methodological quality of studies, primarily
              resulting from insufficient blinding of researchers interpreting
              the reference test. Inadequate reporting, particularly of the
              specific codes validated, hindered comparison of estimates across
              studies. Future validation studies should make use of more robust
              reference tests, follow established reporting guidelines, and

              0.76). AUCs were similar across age decades (0.71 to 0.78) and
              sex (0.72 male, 0.76 female), and across most common diagnostic
              categories other than psychiatry. For individuals in the highest
              risk quartile, 11.4\% experienced fall within 180 days versus
              1.2\% in the lowest risk quartile; 57.6\% of falls occurred in
              the highest risk quartile. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of
              state-wide claims data demonstrates the feasibility of predicting
              fall-related injury requiring hospitalisation using readily
              available sociodemographic and clinical details. This
              translatable approach to stratification allows for identification
              of high-risk individuals in whom interventions are likely to be
              cost-effective.",

              databases: a systematic review",
  author   = "McCormick, N and Lacaille, D and Bhole, V and Avina-Zubieta, J A",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Though administrative databases are increasingly
              being used for research related to myocardial infarction (MI),
              the validity of MI diagnoses in these databases has never been
              synthesized on a large scale. OBJECTIVE: To conduct the first
              systematic review of studies reporting on the validity of
              diagnostic codes for identifying MI in administrative data.
              METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched (inception to November
              2010) for studies: (a) Using administrative data to identify MI;
              or (b) Evaluating the validity of MI codes in administrative
              data; and (c) Reporting validation statistics (sensitivity,
              specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive
              value, or Kappa scores) for MI, or data sufficient for their
              calculation. Additonal articles were located by handsearch (up to
              February 2011) of original papers. Data were extracted by two
              independent reviewers; article quality was assessed using the
              Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. RESULTS:
              Thirty studies published from 1984-2010 were included; most
              assessed codes from the International Classification of Diseases
              (ICD)-9th revision. Sensitivity and specificity of
              hospitalization data for identifying MI in most [>/=50\%] studies
              was >/=86\%, and PPV in most studies was >/=93\%. The PPV was
              higher in the more-recent studies, and lower when criteria that
              do not incorporate cardiac troponin levels (such as the MONICA)
              were employed as the gold standard. MI as a cause-of-death on
              death certificates also demonstrated lower accuracy, with maximum
              PPV of 60\% (for definite MI). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization data
              has higher validity and hence can be used to identify MI, but the
              accuracy of MI as a cause-of-death on death certificates is
              suboptimal, and more studies are needed on the validity of ICD-10
              codes. When using administrative data for research purposes,
              authors should recognize these factors and avoid using vital
              statistics data if hospitalization data is not available to
              confirm deaths from MI.",

              around the world, administrative data have become rich and
              accessible tools for potentially identifying and monitoring
              population trends in diseases including epilepsy. However, it
              remains unclear (1) how accurate administrative data are at
              identifying epilepsy within a population and (2) the optimal
              algorithms needed for administrative data to correctly identify
              people with epilepsy within a population. To address this
              knowledge gap, we will conduct a novel systematic review of all
              identified studies validating administrative healthcare data in
              epilepsy identification. We provide here a protocol that will
              outline the methods and analyses planned for the systematic
              review. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The systematic review described in
              this protocol will be conducted to follow the Preferred Reporting
              Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
              guidelines. MEDLINE and Embase will be searched for studies
              validating administrative data in epilepsy published from 1975 to
              current (01 June 2018). Included studies will validate the
              International Classification of Disease (ICD), Ninth Revision
              (ICD-9) onwards (ie, ICD-9 code 345 and ICD-10 codes G40-G41) as
              well as other non-ICD disease classification systems used, such
              as Read Codes in the UK. The primary outcome will be providing
              pooled estimates of accuracy for identifying epilepsy within the
              administrative databases validated using sensitivity,
              specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and area
              under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Heterogeneity
              will be assessed using the I(2) statistic and descriptive
              analyses used where this is present. The secondary outcome will
              be the optimal administrative data algorithms for correctly
              identifying epilepsy. These will be identified using
              multivariable logistic regression models. 95\% confidence
              intervals will be quoted throughout. We will make an assessment
              of risk of bias, quality of evidence, and completeness of
              reporting for included studies. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical
              approval is not required as primary data will not be collected.

              presented to a tertiary academic urology clinic and evaluate risk
              factors for primary vs. secondary hypogonadism. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: We evaluated all men with International Classification
              of Diseases-9 diagnosis codes R68.82 and 799.81 for low libido,
              257.2 for testicular hypofunction, and E29.1 for other testicular
              hypofunction at a tertiary academic medical center from 2013 to
              2017. We included men who had testosterone (T) and luteinizing
              hormone (LH) drawn on the same day. We classified men based on T
              and LH levels into eugonadal, primary, secondary, and compensated
              hypogonadism. Risk factors including age, body mass index (BMI)
              over 30 kg/m(2), current smoking status, alcohol use greater than
              5 days per week, and Charlson comorbidity index greater than or
              equal to 1 were investigated and measured in each group using the
              eugonadal group for reference. RESULTS: Among the 231 men who had
              both T and LH levels, 7.4\%, 42.4\%, and 7.4\% were classified as
              primary, secondary, and compensated hypogonadism, respectively.
              Only elevated BMI was associated with secondary hypogonadism
              compared to eugonadal men (median BMI, 30.93 kg/m(2) vs. 27.69
              kg/m(2), p=0.003). BMI, age, comorbidities, smoking, or alcohol
              use did not appear to predict diagnosis of secondary
              hypogonadism. CONCLUSIONS: Secondary hypogonadism appears to be
              the most common cause of hypogonadism among men complaining of
              low T and decreased libido at a tertiary academic medical center.
              Secondary hypogonadism is associated with elevated BMI and
              therefore obesity should be used as a marker to evaluate men for
              both T and LH levels.",

              inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but few population-based
              estimates of the burden of depression and anxiety exist. Methods
              to support population-based studies are needed. We aimed to test
              the performance of administrative case definitions for depression
              and anxiety in IBD and to understand what the prevalence
              estimated using such definitions reflects. METHODS: We linked
              administrative (health claims) data from the province of
              Manitoba, Canada with clinical data for 266 persons in the
              Manitoba IBD Cohort Study. We compared the performance of
              administrative case definitions for depression and anxiety with
              (a) diagnoses of depression and anxiety as identified based on
              the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), which
              identifies disorders meeting formal diagnostic criteria, and (b)
              participant report of physician-diagnosed depression or anxiety.
              RESULTS: Administrative definitions for depression showed
              moderate agreement with the CIDI (kappa=0.39-0.42). Agreement was
              higher with participant report of physician-diagnosed depression
              (kappa=0.54). The lifetime prevalence of depression was 29.3\%
              based on the CIDI, 17.7\% based on participant report of
              physician-diagnosed depression, and 21.8-22.5\% based on
              administrative data. Compared to the CIDI, administrative
              definitions for anxiety showed fair agreement (kappa=0.21-0.25).
              The lifetime prevalence of anxiety was 31.2\% based on the CIDI,
              9.7\% based on participant report of physician-diagnosed anxiety,
              and 24.4-31.9\% based on administrative data. CONCLUSIONS:
              Administrative data may be used for population-level surveillance

              opioid use and limiting factors in pain management. This study
              sought to quantify the frequency of antiemetic prescribing and
              the impact of NV on health care resource utilization and costs in
              outpatients prescribed opioids for acute pain. The perspective
              was that of a commercial health plan. METHODS: Medical and
              pharmacy claims from IMS PharMetrics Plus were used to identify
              patients initiating opioid therapy with a prescription for an
              oxycodone-, hydrocodone- or codeine-containing immediate-release
              product for acute use (</=15-day supply) between October 1, 2013
              and September 30, 2014. Patients with a medical claim for NV
              (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
              Clinical Modification codes 787.0x), with or without an
              antiemetic prescription fill, were compared with patients with no
              NV claim or antiemetic prescription fill to assess differences in
              all-cause health care utilization and costs over 1 month.
              Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust for
              between-group differences in baseline patient characteristics.
              RESULTS: The co-prescribing of opioids with antiemetic agents was
              10.2\%. After PSM (n = 45,790 per group), patients with NV claims
              had significantly more hospitalizations (11.5\% vs 4.2\%),
              emergency department visits (65.0\% vs 12.1\%), and physician
              office visits (85.2\% vs 64.5\%) compared with patients with no
              NV claims (all P < 0.0001). Mean total health care costs were
              higher among patients with a NV claim versus those without
              evidence of the side effect ($6290 vs $2309; P < 0.0001). Among
              patients with a recent hospitalization, patients with NV claims
              had higher rates of 30-day rehospitalization than those with no
              NV claims (24.4\% vs 3.0\%; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Among
              outpatients prescribed opioids for management of acute pain,
              co-prescribing with antiemetics was low, and the economic burden
              associated with NV was high. Efforts to prevent NV in patients
              receiving opioid therapy may improve patient outcomes and provide
              cost savings to the health care system. FUNDING: Daiichi Sankyo,

              with 2 visits with ICD-9 codes for gout were extensively reviewed

              patients as having gout by 3 sets of proposed criteria, the

              with the results from the records. RESULTS: Based on medical
              records review there was documentation of gout by the ACR
              criteria in only 36\%, Rome criteria in 30\%, and New York
              criteria in 33\%. Records of patients who had seen
              rheumatologists had better documentation of classification
              features. Interview in clinic of 37 patients also improved
              documentation of the 3 sets of criteria features of gout in
              65\%-81\% of those with ICD-9 codes for gout. CONCLUSION: We
              found it difficult to confirm ICD-9 coded diagnoses of gout using
              currently available proposed criteria from details recorded in
              medical records. This may reflect a problem with available
              criteria and with documentation. Direct interview of patients may
              be needed to confirm the presence of typical features when high
              specificity is desired.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Gout is a common inflammatory arthritis characterized by
              repeated acute flares. The ability to accurately identify gout
              flares is critical for comparative effectiveness studies of gout
              treatments. We developed and examined the accuracy of a
              claims-based algorithm to identify gout flares. METHODS: Patients
              receiving care at an academic medical center between 2006 and
              2010 with a diagnosis of gout or hyperuricemia were selected
              using an electronic medical record-Medicare claims linked
              dataset. Gout flares were identified by several claims-based
              algorithms using a diagnosis of gout combined with gout-related
              medication claims and/or procedure codes for arthrocentesis or
              joint injection. We calculated positive predictive value of these
              algorithms based on physician documentation of gout flare in
              medical record as the gold standard. Negative predictive value of
              the gout flare algorithm was calculated in a randomly selected
              subgroup of 200 patients with gout. RESULTS: Among 3952 subjects
              with gout or hyperuricemia, 503 flares were identified using the
              medication-based algorithm, and 290 were identified using the
              procedure-based algorithm. The positive predictive value for gout
              flares ranged from 50-54\% for the medication-based algorithms
              and 59-68\% for the procedure-based algorithms. The negative
              predictive value of the algorithm combining both medication and
              procedure claims was high (85.2\%). CONCLUSION: Use of gout
              diagnosis codes in combination with medication dispensing or
              procedure codes did not appear to accurately capture gout flares
              in patients with gout in a claims database. However, the
              claims-based flare algorithm could be useful in identifying a
              cohort of gout patients with no flares. Copyright (c) 2016 John

              prevalent chronic diseases in the world with various rate of
              progression among patients, identifying its phenotypic subtypes
              is important for improving risk stratification and providing more
              targeted therapy and specific treatments for patients having
              different trajectories of the disease progression. Problem
              Definition and Data: The rapid growth and adoption of electronic
              health records (EHR) technology has created a unique opportunity
              to leverage the abundant clinical data, available as EHRs, to
              find meaningful phenotypic subtypes for CKD. In this study, we
              focus on extracting disease severity profiles for CKD while
              accounting for other confounding factors. Probabilistic Subtyping
              Model: We employ a probabilistic model to identify precise
              phenotypes from EHR data of patients who have chronic kidney
              disease. Using this model, patient's eGFR trajectory is
              decomposed as a combination of four different components
              including disease subtype effect, covariate effect, individual
              long-term effect and individual short-term effect. Experimental
              Results: The discovered disease subtypes obtained by
              Probabilistic Subtyping Model for CKD are presented and their
              clinical relevance is analyzed. Discussion: Several clinical
              health markers that were found associated with disease subtypes
              are presented with suggestion for further investigation on their
              use as risk predictors. Several assumptions in the study are also
              clarified and discussed. Conclusion: The large dataset of EHRs
              can be used to identify deep phenotypes retrospectively.
              Directions for further expansion of the model are also discussed.",

              principal hospital diagnosis suggestive of SALI (ICD-9-CM 570,

              coagulopathy and hyperbilirubinemia. RESULTS: Among 669 members
              with no pre-existing liver disease, chart review confirmed ALF in
              62 (9\%). Despite the presence of co-existing coagulopathy and
              hyperbilirubinemia, individual ICD-9 diagnoses had low PPVs
              (range, 5-15\%); requiring prescriptions for encephalopathy
              treatment did not increase PPVs of these diagnoses (range,
              2-23\%). Hospital diagnoses of other liver disorders (ICD-9

              95\%CI, 9-99\%) but only identified two (3\%) ALF events.
              CONCLUSIONS: Algorithms comprising relevant hospital diagnoses,
              laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction, and prescriptions for
              hepatic encephalopathy treatment had low PPVs for confirmed ALF

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The prevalence and expenditure estimates of
              Alzheimer's disease (AD) from studies using one data source to
              define cases vary widely. The objectives of this study were to
              assess agreement between AD case definitions classified with
              Medicare claims and survey data and to provide insight into
              causes of widely varied expenditure estimates. METHODS: Data were
              obtained from the 1999-2004 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey
              linked with Medicare claims (n = 57,669). Individuals with AD
              were identified by survey, diagnosis, use of an AD prescription
              medicine, or some combination thereof. We also explored how much
              health care and drug expenditures vary by AD case definition.
              RESULTS: The prevalence of AD differed significantly by case
              definition. Using survey report alone yielded more cases (n =
              1,994 or 3.46\%) than diagnosis codes alone (n = 1,589 or 2.76\%)
              or Alzheimer's medication use alone (n = 1,160 or 2.01\%).
              Agreement between case definitions was low, with kappa
              coefficients ranging from 0.37 to 0.40. Per capita health
              expenditures ranged from $16,547 to $24,937, and drug
              expenditures ranged from $2,303 to $3,519, depending on how AD
              was defined. CONCLUSIONS: Different information sources yield
              widely varied prevalence and expenditure estimates. Although
              claims data provided a more objective means for identifying AD
              cases, survey report identified more cases, and pharmacy data
              also are an important source for case ascertainment. Using any
              single source will underestimate the prevalence and associated
              cost of AD. The wide range of AD cases identified by using
              different data sources demands caution interpreting

              (PUD) vary widely among studies. We conducted a systematic review
              to quantify and examine the discrepancies. METHODS: Of 4780
              articles identified from PubMed and EMBASE databases, 31
              published in the last three decades that had reported IRs of PUD
              in the general population were included. Random effects
              meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed to calculate
              pooled estimates and to identify sources of heterogeneity.
              RESULTS: The pooled IR estimate per 1000 person-years was 0.90
              (95\% confidence interval: 0.78-1.04) for uncomplicated PUD, 0.57
              (0.49-0.65) for peptic ulcer bleeding, 0.10 (0.08-0.13) for
              gastrointestinal perforations, and 3.18 (2.05-4.92) for
              nonspecific PUD. Within specific outcomes definitions, IR
              estimates were significantly lower in studies with restriction to
              hospitalized cases, case validation, and case ascertainment
              directly from hospital or clinical sources versus computerized
              health care databases. Younger age, female sex, and later
              calendar time were also associated with lower PUD incidence.
              CONCLUSIONS: We found that the IR of uncomplicated PUD was in the
              order of one case per 1000 person-years in the general
              population, and that the IR of peptic ulcer complications was
              around 0.7 cases per 1000 person-years. Comparisons of IR
              estimates among studies need to take into account disease
              definition and other study characteristics, particularly whether
              outcome validation was performed in computerized claims. The use
              of claims to identify PUD cases might overestimate the IR by
              around 45\%.",

              States or Canada. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE database from
              1991 to September 2012 using controlled vocabulary and key terms
              related to stillbirth or spontaneous abortion. We also searched
              the reference lists of included studies. Two investigators
              independently assessed the full text of studies against
              pre-determined inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently
              extracted data regarding participant and algorithm
              characteristics and assessed each study's methodological rigor
              using a pre-defined approach. RESULTS: Ten publications
              addressing stillbirth and four addressing spontaneous abortion
              met our inclusion criteria. The International Classification of
              Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes most commonly used in
              algorithms for stillbirth were those for intrauterine death
              (656.4) and stillborn outcomes of delivery (V27.1, V27.3-V27.4,
              and V27.6-V27.7). Papers identifying spontaneous abortion used
              codes for missed abortion and spontaneous abortion: 632, 634.x,
              as well as V27.0-V27.7. Only two studies identifying stillbirth
              reported validation of algorithms. The overall positive
              predictive value of the algorithms was high (99\%-100\%), and one
              study reported an algorithm with 86\% sensitivity. However, the
              predictive value of individual codes was not assessed and study
              populations were limited to specific geographic areas.
              CONCLUSIONS: Additional validation studies with a nationally
              representative sample are needed to confirm the optimal algorithm
              to identify stillbirths or spontaneous abortion in administrative
              and claims databases.'",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Ejection fraction (EF) is crucial information when
              studying the use and effectiveness of therapies in patients with
              heart failure (HF) and myocardial infarction (MI). We aimed to
              assess the validity of claims data-based definitions of systolic
              dysfunction (SD). METHODS: We identified 1072 patients with EF
              recorded for an HF/MI hospitalization in Medicare linked with
              pharmacy data and national HF/MI registries in 1999-2006.
              Thirteen claims-based definitions for SD were developed using a
              single or combination of ICD-9 diagnosis codes and cardiovascular
              medications use. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and
              positive predictive values (PPVs) using recorded EFs as the gold
              standard. RESULTS: Using an EF cutoff of 45\%, the definitions
              based on digoxin use and no atrial fibrillation or flutter had
              the highest PPVs (76\% to 84\%) and specificity (>97\%) but low
              sensitivity (6\%-14\%). As we varied the EF cutoff between 50\%
              and 25\%, the specificity decreased by 3\%, but the PPVs
              decreased by 52\%. We observed potential differences in the PPVs
              by patients' characteristics. In a hypothetical study assessing
              implantable defibrillator effectiveness, using our definition to
              identify patients with SD would underestimate the effectiveness
              by 3\% to 24\%. In another hypothetical study comparing two
              classes of angiotensin system blockers where SD was considered
              confounding, our definition introduced ~43\% misclassification
              bias. CONCLUSIONS: Claims-based definitions for SD had excellent
              specificity and good PPV but low sensitivity. The definitions
              with good PPV could be used for cohort identification or
              confounding adjustment by restriction and would result in
              relatively small misclassification bias albeit limited

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Health administrative data are frequently used for
              diabetes surveillance. We aimed to determine the sensitivity and
              specificity of a commonly-used diabetes case definition (two
              physician claims or one hospital discharge abstract record within
              a two-year period) and their potential effect on prevalence
              estimation. METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for
              Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we
              searched Medline (from 1950) and Embase (from 1980) databases for
              validation studies through August 2012 (keywords: ``diabetes
              mellitus''; ``administrative databases''; ``validation
              studies''). Reviewers abstracted data with standardized forms and
              assessed quality using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy
              Studies (QUADAS) criteria. A generalized linear model approach to
              random-effects bivariate regression meta-analysis was used to
              pool sensitivity and specificity estimates. We applied correction
              factors derived from pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates
              to prevalence estimates from national surveillance reports and
              projected prevalence estimates over 10 years (to 2018). RESULTS:
              The search strategy identified 1423 abstracts among which 11
              studies were deemed relevant and reviewed; 6 of these reported
              sensitivity and specificity allowing pooling in a meta-analysis.
              Compared to surveys or medical records, sensitivity was 82.3\%
              (95\%CI 75.8, 87.4) and specificity was 97.9\% (95\%CI 96.5,
              98.8). The diabetes case definition underestimated prevalence
              when it was </=10.6\% and overestimated prevalence otherwise.
              CONCLUSION: The diabetes case definition examined misses up to
              one fifth of diabetes cases and wrongly identifies diabetes in
              approximately 2\% of the population. This may be sufficiently
              sensitive and specific for surveillance purposes, in particular
              monitoring prevalence trends. Applying correction factors to
              adjust prevalence estimates from this definition may be helpful
              to increase accuracy of estimates.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The development of acute kidney injury (AKI) after
              cardiac surgery is associated with significant mortality,
              morbidity, and cost. The last decade has seen major changes in
              the complexity of cardiac surgical candidates and in the number
              and type of cardiac surgical procedures being performed. METHODS:
              Using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we determined
              the annual rates of AKI, AKI requiring dialysis (AKI-D), and
              inpatient mortality after cardiac surgery in the United States in
              the years 1999 through 2008. RESULTS: Inpatient mortality with
              AKI and AKI-D decreased from 27.9\% and 45.9\%, respectively, in
              1999 to 12.8\% and 35.3\%, respectively, in 2008. Compared with
              1999, the odds of AKI and AKI-D in 2008, adjusted for demographic
              and clinical factors, were 3.30 (95\% confidence interval [CI]:
              2.89 to 3.77) and 2.23 (95\% CI: 1.78 to 2.80), respectively.
              Corresponding adjusted odds of death associated with AKI and
              AKI-D were 0.31 (95\% CI: 0.26 to 0.36) and 0.47 (95\% CI: 0.34
              to 0.65.) Taken together, the attributable risks for death after
              cardiac surgery associated with AKI and AKI-D increased from 30\%
              and 5\%, respectively, in 1999 to 47\% and 14\%, respectively, in
              2008. CONCLUSIONS: In sum, despite improvements in individual
              patient outcomes over the decade 1999 to 2008, the population
              contribution of AKI and AKI-D to inpatient mortality after

              for efficient, real time identification of diseases. METHODS: We
              studied automated records from 1996 through 1999 of approximately
              250,000 health plan members in greater Boston. RESULTS: We
              identified 152,435 lower respiratory infection illness visits,
              comprising 106,670 episodes during 1,143,208 person-years. Three
              diagnoses, cough (ICD9CM 786.2), pneumonia not otherwise
              specified (ICD9CM 486) and acute bronchitis (ICD9CM 466.0)
              accounted for 91\% of these visits, with expected age and sex
              distributions. Variation of weekly occurrences corresponded
              closely to national pneumonia and influenza mortality data. There
              was substantial variation in geographic location of the cases.
              CONCLUSION: This information complements existing surveillance
              programs by assessing the large majority of episodes of illness
              for which no etiologic agents are identified. Additional
              advantages include: a) sensitivity, uniformity and efficiency,
              since detection of events does not depend on clinicians' to
              actively report diagnoses, b) timeliness, the data are available
              within a day of the clinical event; and c) ease of integration
              into automated surveillance systems. These features facilitate
              early detection of conditions of public health importance,
              including regularly occurring events like seasonal respiratory
              illness, as well as unusual occurrences, such as a bioterrorist
              attack that first manifests as respiratory symptoms. These
              methods should also be applicable to other infectious and
              non-infectious conditions. Knowledge of disease patterns in real

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are
              associated with an elevated risk of peptic ulcer and upper
              gastrointestinal hemorrhage, but published reports have lacked
              information on rates of outpatient disease, have concentrated on
              the elderly, and have not provided comparisons of rates for
              specific types of NSAIDs. METHODS: We compared incidence rates of
              peptic ulcer and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 68 028
              people younger than 65 years who used diclofenac sodium,
              naproxen, piroxicam, or sulindac, and who were members of a
              network of health maintenance organizations. We reviewed
              automated insurance claims data and medical records to ascertain
              cases and included conditions treated on an outpatient basis.
              RESULTS: Medical claims data were adequate for crude
              identification of potential cases, but review of medical records
              led to rejection of 63\% of these, representing either no
              abnormality or diseases other than peptic ulcer or upper
              gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Of the total 112 cases, 64 (57\%)
              were treated as outpatients. The crude incidence rate per 1000
              person-years in users of any current, recent, or past NSAID was
              2.2 and in distant-past users of NSAIDs was 0.75. For diclofenac,
              naproxen, piroxicam, and sulindac, we found a consistent pattern
              of decreasing NSAID effects from current to recent to past
              exposure. The risk of peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal
              hemorrhage was 1.6 cases per 1000 people using NSAIDs.
              CONCLUSIONS: Combining use of automated claims records with
              review of medical records promotes efficiency while maintaining
              specificity of case ascertainment. This study, with 57\% of cases
              treated as outpatients, had results consistent with other
              published reports that were based on hospitalized patients.
              Within the limits of statistical error, the incidence rates of

              Results: From Danish National Registries, we identified 44 799
              hypertensive patients, aged 30 years or older, who had a serum
              potassium measurement within 90 days from diagnosis between 1995
              and 2012. All-cause mortality was analysed according to seven
              predefined potassium levels: 5.0 mmol/L (hyperkalaemia). Outcome
              was 90-day mortality, estimated with multivariable Cox
              proportional hazard model, with the potassium interval of 4.1-4.4
              mmol/L as reference. During 90-day follow,  mortalities in the
              seven strata were 4.5, 2.7, 1.8, 1.5, 1.7, 2.7, and 3.6\%,

              2.80, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 2.17-3.62], and
              hyperkalaemia (HR: 1.70, 95\% CI: 1.36-2.13). Notably, normal
              potassium levels were also associated with increased mortality:
              K: 3.5-3.7 mmol/L (HR: 1.70, 95\% CI: 1.36-2.13), K: 3.8-4.0

              1.48, 95\% CI: 1.15-1.92). Thus, mortality in relation to the
              seven potassium ranges was U-shaped, with the lowest mortality in
              the interval of 4.1-4.4 mmol/L. Conclusion: Potassium levels
              outside the interval of 4.1-4.7 mmol/L were associated with

              medical and pharmacy benefits since birth were identified
              separately in Truven Commercial Claims and Encounters (2000-2011)
              and Truven Medicaid Claims (2002-2010) and observed until the
              first of end of insurance eligibility or five years. Infants with
              >/=1 RV vaccine within the vaccination window (6 weeks-8 months)
              were divided into completely and incompletely vaccinated cohorts.
              Historically unvaccinated (before 2007) and contemporarily
              unvaccinated (2007 and after) cohorts included children without
              RV vaccine. Claims with International Classification of Disease
              9th edition (ICD-9) codes for diarrhea and RV were identified.
              First RV episode incidence, RV-related and diarrhea-related
              healthcare resource utilization after 8 months old were
              calculated and compared across groups. Poisson regressions were
              used to generate incidence rates with 95\% confidence intervals
              (CIs). Mean total, inpatient, outpatient and emergency room costs
              for first RV and diarrhea episodes were calculated; bootstrapping
              was used to construct 95\% CIs to evaluate cost differences.
              RESULTS: 1,069,485 Commercial and 515,557 Medicaid patients met
              inclusion criteria. Among commercially insured, RV incidence per
              10,000 person-years was 3.3 (95\% CI 2.8-3.9) for completely, 4.0
              (95\% CI 3.3-5.0) for incompletely vaccinated, and 20.9 (95\% CI
              19.5-22.4) for contemporarily and 40.3 (95\% CI 38.6-42.1) for
              historically unvaccinated. Rates in Medicaid were 7.5 (95\% CI
              4.8-11.8) for completely, 9.0 (95\% CI 6.5-12.3) for incompletely
              vaccinated, and 14.6 (95\% CI 12.8-16.7) for contemporarily and
              52.0 (95\% CI 50.2-53.8) for historically unvaccinated. Mean cost
              for first RV episode per cohort member was \$15.33 (95\% CI

              determine the 12-month incidence and prevalence of dementia for
              the 2012/13 period (1) among individuals aged 45 and older in the

              (3) according to diagnosis code and other case definition
              criteria. METHODS: We used a population-based retrospective
              cohort study design and extracted data from 10 provincial health
              databases linked by a unique health services number. The cohort
              included individuals 45 years and older at first identification
              of dementia between April 1, 2001 and March 31, 2013 based on

              databases (Hospital Discharge Abstracts, Physician Service
              Claims, Prescription Drug, and RAI-MDS, i.e., Long-term Care).
              RESULTS: A total of 3,270 incident cases of dementia (7.28 per
              1,000 PAR) and 13,012 prevalent cases (28.16 per 1,000 PAR) were
              identified during 2012/13. This study found the incidence rate
              increased by 2.8 to 5.1 times and the prevalence rate increased
              by 2.6 to 4.6 times every 10 years after 45 years of age.
              Overall, the age-standardised incidence rate was significantly
              lower among females than males (7.04 vs. 7.65 per 1,000 PAR) and
              the age-standardised prevalence rate was significantly higher
              among females than males (28.92 vs. 26.53 per 1,000 PAR). Over
              one-quarter (28 \%) of all incident cases were admitted to
              long-term care before a diagnosis was formally recorded in
              physician or hospital data, and nearly two-thirds of these cases

              symptoms occurred preceding the diagnosis of peripheral artery

              study was to investigate the risk of PAOD among patients with
              vertigo, tinnitus, and sudden deafness using a nationwide,
              population-based health claim database in Taiwan. METHODS: We
              identified 5,340 adult patients with PAOD diagnosed between
              January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2010 and 16,020 controls,
              frequency matched on age interval, sex, and year of index date,

              several algorithms using a combination of International
              Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes and drug
              use data. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive
              predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value of these
              algorithms using outpatient laboratory data within 3 months of
              the diagnosis as the gold standard to ascertain cases of mild
              (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1,500/muL) and severe (ANC
              <500/muL) neutropenia. RESULTS: Among 95,742 eligible subjects,
              867 patients were identified with any ICD-9 codes for
              neutropenia. This algorithm had high specificity (99\%), but low
              sensitivity (9\%) and PPV (18\%) for mild neutropenia. Among the
              subjects identified with the ICD-9 288.0 (N = 203), sensitivity
              was 4\% and PPV was 33\%. Specificity and PPV of the algorithm
              that combined any ICD-9 codes for neutropenia with dispensing of
              pegfilgrastim or filgrastim were 100 and 56\% for mild
              neutropenia, respectively. Sensitivity was 1\%. All algorithms
              had slightly higher sensitivity, but lower PPV for severe
              neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: Use of ICD-9 codes for neutropenia in
              combination with drug use data did not appear to accurately
              identify outpatient diagnosis of neutropenia without using
              laboratory results, but it may be useful in determining the
              absence of neutropenia in claims data.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: High-grade cervical dysplasia or cervical
              intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse has been widely used
              as a surrogate endpoint in cervical cancer screening or
              prevention trials. METHODS: To identify high-grade cervical
              dysplasia and cervical cancer, we developed claims-based
              algorithms that incorporated a combination of diagnosis and
              procedure codes using the billing data in an electronic medical
              records database and assessed the validity of the algorithms in
              an independent administrative claims database. We calculated the
              positive predictive value (PPV) with the 95\% confidence interval
              (CI) of each algorithm, using new cytologic or pathologic
              diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3, carcinoma
              in situ, or cervical cancer as the gold standard. RESULTS: Having
              >/=1 diagnosis code for high-grade cervical dysplasia or cervical
              cancer had a PPV of 57.1\% (95\%CI, 54.7-59.5\%). By requiring
              >/=2 diagnoses for high-grade cervical dysplasia or cervical
              cancer, separated by 7-30 days, the PPV increased to 60.2\%
              (95\%CI, 53.9-66.1\%). At least two diagnoses and a procedure
              code within a month from the first diagnosis date yielded a PPV
              of 80.7\% (95\%CI, 73.6-86.2\%). The algorithms had greater PPVs
              in identifying prevalent high-grade cervical dysplasia or
              cervical cancer. Overall, the PPVs of these algorithms were
              similar or slightly lower in the external claims data than in the
              sample used to derive the algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: Use of >/=2
              diagnosis codes in combination with a procedure code appears to
              be a valid tool for studying high-grade cervical dysplasia and
              cervical cancer in both electronic medical record and

              systematically reviewed. Using surrogates for identifying
              potential BRONJ cases from a population-based hospital registry,
              validation was performed through medical chart review. Positive
              predictive value (PPV) was estimated for each diagnostic code and
              for the overall algorithm utilized. Various strategies to
              increase PPV were also performed. Seventeen studies were
              systematically reviewed and presented with variations in study
              quality as well as inconsistent findings. Moreover, there was a
              high level of methodological heterogeneity. A total of 1920
              patients were identified through the ICD-10 algorithm with
              potential BRONJ, although only 109 cases were confirmed,
              corresponding to an overall PPV of 5.68\% (95\% confidence

              showed that the overall PPV for BRONJ identification was very

              possible overestimation of ONJ occurrence. There is an urgent
              need to develop more reliable and specific operational
              definitions for the identification of BRONJ cases in large

              outcomes of health care interventions in older adults that is not
              readily measured in Medicare data. This study aimed to develop
              and validate a claims-based frailty index (CFI). Methods: We used
              data from Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey 2006 (development
              sample: n = 5,593) and 2011 (validation sample: n = 4,424). A CFI
              was developed using the 2006 claims data to approximate a
              survey-based frailty index (SFI) calculated from the 2006 survey
              data as a reference standard. We compared CFI to combined
              comorbidity index (CCI) in the ability to predict death,
              disability, recurrent falls, and health care utilization in 2007.
              As validation, we calculated a CFI using the 2011 claims data to
              predict these outcomes in 2012. Results: The CFI was correlated
              with SFI (correlation coefficient: 0.60). In the development
              sample, CFI was similar to CCI in predicting mortality (C
              statistic: 0.77 vs. 0.78), but better than CCI for disability,
              mobility impairment, and recurrent falls (C statistic: 0.62-0.66
              vs. 0.56-0.60). Although both indices similarly explained the
              variation in hospital days, CFI outperformed CCI in explaining
              the variation in skilled nursing facility days. Adding CFI to
              age, sex, and CCI improved prediction. In the validation sample,
              CFI and CCI performed similarly for mortality (C statistic: 0.71
              vs. 0.72). Other results were comparable to those from the
              development sample. Conclusion: A novel frailty index can measure
              the risk for adverse health outcomes that is not otherwise

              databases have become more accessible and are now used regularly
              for diabetes surveillance. The objective of this study is to
              systematically review validated International Classification of
              Diseases (ICD)-based case definitions for diabetes in the adult
              population. SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES:
              Electronic databases, MEDLINE and Embase, were searched for
              validation studies where an administrative case definition (using
              ICD codes) for diabetes in adults was validated against a
              reference and statistical measures of the performance reported.
              RESULTS: The search yielded 2895 abstracts, and of the 193
              potentially relevant studies, 16 met criteria. Diabetes
              definition for adults varied by data source, including physician
              claims (sensitivity ranged from 26.9\% to 97\%, specificity

              kappa ranged from 0.7 to 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
              administrative health databases are useful for undertaking
              diabetes surveillance, but an awareness of the variation in
              performance being affected by case definition is essential. The
              performance characteristics of these case definitions depend on
              the variations in the definition of primary diagnosis in

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Statutory State-based cancer registries are
              considered the 'gold standard' for researchers identifying cancer
              cases in Australia, but research using self-report or
              administrative health datasets (e.g. hospital records) may not
              have linkage to a Cancer Registry and need to identify cases.
              This study investigated the validity of administrative and
              self-reported data compared with records in a State-wide Cancer
              Registry in identifying invasive breast cancer cases. METHODS:
              Cases of invasive breast cancer recorded on the New South Wales
              (NSW) Cancer Registry between July 2004 and December 2008 (the
              study period) were identified for women in the 45 and Up Study.
              Registry cases were separately compared with suspected cases
              ascertained from: i) administrative hospital separations records;
              ii) outpatient medical service claims; iii) prescription
              medicines claims; and iv) the 45 and Up Study baseline survey.
              Ascertainment flags included diagnosis codes, surgeries (e.g.
              lumpectomy), services (e.g. radiotherapy), and medicines used for
              breast cancer, as well as self-reported diagnosis. Positive
              predictive value (PPV), sensitivity and specificity were
              calculated for flags within individual datasets, and for
              combinations of flags across multiple datasets. RESULTS: Of
              143,010 women in the 45 and Up Study, 2039 (1.4\%) had an
              invasive breast tumour recorded on the NSW Cancer Registry during
              the study period. All of the breast cancer flags examined had
              high specificity (>97.5\%). Of the flags from individual
              datasets, hospital-derived 'lumpectomy and diagnosis of invasive
              breast cancer' and '(lumpectomy or mastectomy) and diagnosis of
              invasive breast cancer' had the greatest PPV (89\% and 88\%,
              respectively); the later having greater sensitivity (59\% and
              82\%, respectively). The flag with the highest sensitivity and
              PPV >/= 85\% was 'diagnosis of invasive breast cancer' (both
              86\%). Self-reported breast cancer diagnosis had a PPV of 50\%
              and sensitivity of 85\%, and breast radiotherapy had a PPV of
              73\% and a sensitivity of 58\% compared with Cancer Registry
              records. The combination of flags with the greatest PPV and
              sensitivity was '(lumpectomy or mastectomy) and (diagnosis of
              invasive breast cancer or breast radiotherapy)' (PPV and
              sensitivity 83\%). CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of Cancer Registry
              data, administrative and self-reported data can be used to
              accurately identify cases of invasive breast cancer for sample
              identification, removing cases from a sample, or risk adjustment.
              Invasive breast cancer can be accurately identified using
              hospital-derived diagnosis alone or in combination with surgeries
              and breast radiotherapy.",

              convulsion, or epilepsy cases in administrative and claims data,
              with a focus on studies that have examined the validity of the
              algorithms. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using
              PubMed and the Iowa Drug Information Service database. Reviews
              were conducted by two investigators to identify studies using
              data sources from the USA or Canada because these data sources
              were most likely to reflect the coding practices of Mini-Sentinel
              data partners. RESULTS: Eleven studies that validated seizure,
              convulsion, or epilepsy cases were identified. All algorithms
              included International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
              Revision, Clinical Modification code 345.X (epilepsy) and either
              code 780.3 (convulsions) or code 780.39 (other convulsions). Six
              studies included 333.2 (myoclonus). In populations that included
              children, 779.0 (convulsions in newborn) was also fairly common.
              Positive predictive values (PPVs) ranged from 21\% to 98\%.
              Studies that used nonspecific indicators such as presence of an
              electroencephalogram or anti-epileptic drug (AED) level
              monitoring had lower PPVs. In studies focusing exclusively on
              epilepsy as opposed to isolated seizure events, sensitivity
              ranged from 70\% to 99\%. CONCLUSIONS: Algorithm performance was
              highly variable, so it is difficult to draw any strong
              conclusions. However, the PPVs were generally best in studies
              where epilepsy diagnoses were required. Using procedure codes for
              electroencephalograms or prescription claims for drugs possibly
              used for epilepsy or convulsions in the absence of a diagnostic

              hospitalization and amongst the leading causes of death in
              Germany. However, accurate estimates of prevalence and incidence
              are lacking. Reported figures originating from different
              information sources are compromised by factors like economic
              reasons or documentation quality. METHODS: We implemented a
              clinical data warehouse that integrates various information
              sources (structured parameters, plain text, data extracted by
              natural language processing) and enables reliable approximations
              to the real number of heart failure patients. Performance of
              ICD-based diagnosis in detecting heart failure was compared
              across the years 2000-2015 with (a) advanced definitions based on
              algorithms that integrate various sources of the hospital
              information system, and (b) a physician-based reference standard.
              RESULTS: Applying these methods for detecting heart failure in
              inpatients revealed that relying on ICD codes resulted in a
              marked underestimation of the true prevalence of heart failure,
              ranging from 44\% in the validation dataset to 55\% (single year)
              and 31\% (all years) in the overall analysis. Percentages changed
              over the years, indicating secular changes in coding practice and
              efficiency. Performance was markedly improved using search and
              permutation algorithms from the initial expert-specified query
              (F1 score of 81\%) to the computer-optimized query (F1 score of
              86\%) or, alternatively, optimizing precision or sensitivity
              depending on the search objective. CONCLUSIONS: Estimating
              prevalence of heart failure using ICD codes as the sole data
              source yielded unreliable results. Diagnostic accuracy was
              markedly improved using dedicated search algorithms. Our approach

              routinely collected primary care electronic data to support
              policy and practice for common mental disorders (CMD) anxiety and
              depression would be greatly enhanced by appropriate validation of
              diagnostic codes and algorithms for data extraction. We aimed to
              create a robust research platform for CMD using population-based,
              routinely collected primary care electronic data. METHODS: We
              developed a set of Read code lists (diagnosis, symptoms,
              treatments) for the identification of anxiety and depression in
              the General Practice Database (GPD) within the Secure Anonymised
              Information Linkage Databank at Swansea University, and assessed
              12 algorithms for Read codes to define cases according to various
              criteria. Annual incidence rates were calculated per 1000 person
              years at risk (PYAR) to assess recording practice for these CMD
              between January 1(st) 2000 and December 31(st) 2009. We
              anonymously linked the 2799 MHI-5 Caerphilly Health and Social
              Needs Survey (CHSNS) respondents aged 18 to 74 years to their
              routinely collected GP data in SAIL. We estimated the
              sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of the
              various algorithms using the MHI-5 as the gold standard. RESULTS:
              The incidence of combined depression/anxiety diagnoses remained
              stable over the ten-year period in a population of over 500,000
              but symptoms increased from 6.5 to 20.7 per 1000 PYAR. A
              'historical' GP diagnosis for depression/anxiety currently
              treated plus a current diagnosis (treated or untreated) resulted
              in a specificity of 0.96, sensitivity 0.29 and PPV 0.76. Adding
              current symptom codes improved sensitivity (0.32) with a marginal
              effect on specificity (0.95) and PPV (0.74). CONCLUSIONS: We have
              developed an algorithm with a high specificity and PPV of
              detecting cases of anxiety and depression from routine GP data
              that incorporates symptom codes to reflect GP coding behaviour.
              We have demonstrated that using diagnosis and current treatment
              alone to identify cases for depression and anxiety using
              routinely collected primary care data will miss a number of true
              cases given changes in GP recording behaviour. The Read code
              lists plus the developed algorithms will be applicable to other
              routinely collected primary care datasets, creating a platform

              due to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, phenytoin, valproic acid, and
              isoniazid. METHODS: In search 1, electronic medical records from
              patients seen between 1994 and 2004 with an ICD-9-CM code of
              acute liver injury were identified and cross-searched for the
              specific drug names in the dictation text. In search 2, all
              patients with an ICD-9-CM code of drug poisoning/overdose due to
              one of the four study drugs were identified. In search 3,
              patients with a poisoning code as well as an acute liver injury
              code were identified. RESULTS: Review of the records from the
              7,395 search 1 patients yielded 51 DILI cases (0.7\%). In
              contrast, the 566 search 2 patients yielded only three DILI cases

              a low rate of detection with only two patients (3.9\%) having

              ICD-9-CM codes combined with a text search of the dictated
              medical record yielded the greatest number of DILI cases but was
              less specific than crossing acute liver injury and poisoning

              publications during 1997-2008 that identified patients with
              atrial fibrillation (AF) from electronic health data and provided
              validation information. We abstracted information including
              algorithm sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value

              articles, of which 18 provided validation information from 16
              unique studies. Most used data from before 2000, and 10 of 16
              used only inpatient data. Three studies incorporated electronic
              ECG data for case identification or validation. A large
              proportion of prevalent AF cases identified by ICD-9 code 427.31
              were valid (PPV 70\%-96\%, median 89\%). Seven studies reported
              algorithm sensitivity (range, 57\%-95\%, median 79\%). One study
              validated an algorithm for incident AF and reported a PPV of

              few recent data, use of nonrepresentative populations, and a

              been successfully developed for many chronic conditions. The
              increasing use of electronic medical records (EMRs) by family
              physicians (FPs) provides a novel reference standard by which to
              evaluate these algorithms as FPs are the first point of contact
              and providers of ongoing medical care for persons with AD-RD.
              OBJECTIVE: We used FP EMR data as the reference standard to
              evaluate the accuracy of population-based health administrative
              data in identifying older adults with AD-RD over time. METHODS:
              This retrospective chart abstraction study used a random sample
              of EMRs for 3,404 adults over 65 years of age from 83
              community-based FPs in Ontario, Canada. AD-RD patients identified
              in the EMR were used as the reference standard against which
              algorithms identifying cases of AD-RD in administrative databases
              were compared. RESULTS: The highest performing algorithm was
              ``one hospitalization code OR (three physician claims codes at
              least 30 days apart in a two year period) OR a prescription
              filled for an AD-RD specific medication'' with sensitivity 79.3\%
              (confidence interval (CI) 72.9-85.8\%), specificity 99.1\% (CI
              98.8-99.4\%), positive predictive value 80.4\% (CI 74.0-86.8\%),
              and negative predictive value 99.0\% (CI 98.7-99.4\%). This
              resulted in an age- and sex-adjusted incidence of 18.1 per 1,000
              persons and adjusted prevalence of 72.0 per 1,000 persons in
              2010/11. CONCLUSION: Algorithms developed from health
              administrative data are sensitive and specific for identifying
              older adults with AD-RD.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: To identify algorithms that can capture incident cases
              of myocarditis and pericarditis in administrative and claims
              databases; these algorithms can eventually be used to identify
              cardiac inflammatory adverse events following vaccine
              administration. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE from 1991 to
              September 2012 using controlled vocabulary and key terms related
              to myocarditis. We also searched the reference lists of included
              studies. Two investigators independently assessed the full text
              of studies against pre-determined inclusion criteria. Two
              reviewers independently extracted data regarding participant and
              algorithm characteristics as well as study conduct. RESULTS: Nine
              publications (including one study reported in two publications)
              met criteria for inclusion. Two studies performed medical record
              review in order to confirm that these coding algorithms actually
              captured patients with the disease of interest. One of these
              studies identified five potential cases, none of which were
              confirmed as acute myocarditis upon review. The other study,
              which employed a search algorithm based on diagnostic
              surveillance (using ICD-9 codes 420.90, 420.99, 422.90, 422.91

              2002 and 2003. Neither study provided algorithm validation
              statistics (positive predictive value, sensitivity, or
              specificity). CONCLUSIONS: A validated search algorithm is
              currently unavailable for identifying incident cases of
              pericarditis or myocarditis. Several authors have published
              unvalidated ICD-9-based search algorithms that appear to capture
              myocarditis events occurring in the context of other underlying

              Retrospective analysis of claims data from the North Carolina
              State Health Plan for Teachers and State Employees from 2000 to
              2009. Data were extracted from Blue Cross Blue Shield of North
              Carolina for the North Carolina State Health Plan using
              International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
              diagnostic codes for headache. The claims were separated by
              individual provider type, combination of provider types, and
              referral patterns. RESULTS: The majority of patients and claims
              were in the MD-only or MD plus referral patterns. Chiropractic
              patterns represented less than 10\% of patients. Care patterns
              with single-provider types and no referrals incurred the least
              charges on average for headache. When care did not include
              referral providers or services, MD with DC care was generally
              less expensive than MD care with PT. However, when combined with
              referral care, MD care with PT was generally less expensive.
              Compared with MD-only care, risk-adjusted charges (available
              2006-2009) for patients in the middle risk quintile were
              significantly less for DC-only care. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization and
              expenditures for headache treatment increased from 2000 to 2009
              across all provider groups. MD care represented the majority of
              total allowed charges in this study. MD care and DC care, alone
              or in combination, were overall the least expensive patterns of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Accidental falls among people aged 65 years and older
              caused approximately 2,700,000 injuries, 27,000 deaths, and cost
              more than 34 billion dollars in the US annually in recent years.
              Here, we derive and validate a predictive model for falls based
              on a retrospective cohort of those 65 years and older. METHODS:
              Insurance claims from a 1-year observational period were used to
              predict a fall-related claim in the following 2 years. The
              predictive model takes into account a person's age, sex,
              prescriptions, and diagnoses. Through random assignment, half of
              the people had their claims used to derive the model, while the
              remaining people had their claims used to validate the model.
              RESULTS: Of 120,881 individuals with Aetna health insurance
              coverage, 12,431 (10.3\%) members fell. During validation, people
              were risk stratified across 20 levels, where those in the highest
              risk stratum had 10.5 times the risk as those in the lowest
              stratum (33.1\% vs 3.1\%). CONCLUSIONS: Using only insurance
              claims, individuals in this large cohort at high risk of falls
              could be readily identified up to 2 years in advance. Although
              external validation is needed, the findings support the use of
              the model to better target interventions.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In recent clinical guidelines, individuals with
              chronic kidney disease are considered to have a similar 10-year
              absolute risk of cardiovascular death as individuals with
              diabetes or established cardiovascular disease. There is limited
              evidence to support this claim. METHODS: We investigated the
              10-year risk for cardiovascular death in individuals with
              moderate or severe chronic kidney disease (glomerular filtration
              rate of 30-60 or <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively) in a cohort
              of primary care health check-ups in Stockholm, Sweden (n =
              295,191, 46\% women, 4290 cardiovascular deaths during 10 years
              follow-up). We also assessed the risk associated with diabetes or
              cardiovascular disease. The inclusion criteria, exposure, study
              outcome and follow-up period adhered strictly to the definitions
              of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. RESULTS: The
              absolute 10-year risk of cardiovascular death was 3.9\% and
              14.0\% in individuals with moderate and severe chronic kidney
              disease, respectively, but was substantially lower in women and
              in younger individuals. The risk in individuals with prevalent
              diabetes and cardiovascular disease was approximately two and
              three times higher compared to the risk estimate for moderate
              chronic kidney disease (hazard ratio (HR) 4.1, 95\% confidence
              interval (CI) 3.8-4.5 and HR 6.2, 95\% CI 5.7-6.7 vs. HR 2.3 95\%
              CI 2.0-2.6, respectively) while the risk for individuals with
              severe chronic kidney disease appeared more congruent to that of
              diabetes and cardiovascular disease (HR 5.5, 95\% CI 3.3-8.9).
              CONCLUSIONS: Although moderate chronic kidney disease is an
              independent predictor for an increased 10-year risk of
              cardiovascular death, only those with severe chronic kidney
              disease had similar risk to those with diabetes or cardiovascular

              record sources in primary care, hospital care, a disease
              registry, and mortality register. DESIGN: Cohort study.
              PARTICIPANTS: 21 482 patients with acute myocardial infarction in
              England between January 2003 and March 2009, identified in four
              prospectively collected, linked electronic health record sources:
              Clinical Practice Research Datalink (primary care data), Hospital
              Episode Statistics (hospital admissions), the disease registry
              MINAP (Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project), and the
              Office for National Statistics mortality register (cause specific
              mortality data). SETTING: One country (England) with one health
              system (the National Health Service). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
              Recording of acute myocardial infarction, incidence, all cause
              mortality within one year of acute myocardial infarction, and
              diagnostic validity of acute myocardial infarction compared with
              electrocardiographic and troponin findings in the disease
              registry (gold standard). RESULTS: Risk factors and
              non-cardiovascular coexisting conditions were similar across
              patients identified in primary care, hospital admission, and
              registry sources. Immediate all cause mortality was highest among
              patients with acute myocardial infarction recorded in primary
              care, which (unlike hospital admission and disease registry
              sources) included patients who did not reach hospital, but at one
              year mortality rates in cohorts from each source were similar.
              5561 (31.0\%) patients with non-fatal acute myocardial infarction
              were recorded in all three sources and 11 482 (63.9\%) in at
              least two sources. The crude incidence of acute myocardial
              infarction was underestimated by 25-50\% using one source
              compared with using all three sources. Compared with acute
              myocardial infarction defined in the disease registry, the
              positive predictive value of acute myocardial infarction recorded
              in primary care was 92.2\% (95\% confidence interval 91.6\% to
              92.8\%) and in hospital admissions was 91.5\% (90.8\% to 92.1\%).
              CONCLUSION: Each data source missed a substantial proportion
              (25-50\%) of myocardial infarction events. Failure to use linked
              electronic health records from primary care, hospital care,
              disease registry, and death certificates may lead to biased
              estimates of the incidence and outcome of myocardial infarction.

  abstract = "PURPOSE: To systematically review published studies for
              algorithms that identified lymphoma as a health outcome of
              interest in administrative or claims data and examined the
              validity of the algorithm to identify lymphoma cases. METHODS: A
              systematic literature search was executed using PubMed and the
              Iowa Drug Information Service database. Two investigators
              reviewed search results to identify studies using administrative
              or claims databases from the USA or Canada that both reported and
              validated an algorithm to identify lymphoma. RESULTS: The search
              identified 713 unique citations with 402 eliminated by an initial
              screen of the article abstract. The remaining 311 resulted in one
              study that identified and validated an algorithm. Ten other
              studies reported algorithms but were not validated. The validated
              study reported four possible algorithms that had a specificity (>
              99\%), but the algorithm using two diagnostic codes recorded
              within 2 months had the best positive predictive value (PPV =
              62.83\%) and a sensitivity (79.81\%). The most comprehensive
              algorithm required multiple diagnostic codes 2 months apart or
              diagnostic, and procedure codes on the same day had the greatest
              sensitivity (88.31\%) and a PPV = 56.69\%. The algorithm that
              required only a single diagnostic or procedure code had the worst
              PPV (34.72\%). CONCLUSION: The International Classification of
              Disease, Ninth Revision diagnostic, clinical procedure, and
              complication codes for lymphoma can identify incident hematologic
              malignancies and solid tumors with high specificity but with
              relatively low to moderate sensitivity and PPVs. When diagnostic
              and procedure codes were required on the same visit or multiple
              codes between visits, then PPV was increased. Relying on a single
              registry to confirm true positive cases is also not sufficient.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Sudden cardiac death (SD) and ventricular arrhythmias
              (VAs) caused by medications have arisen as an important public
              health concern in recent years. The validity of diagnostic codes
              in identifying SD/VA events originating in the ambulatory setting
              is not well known. This study examined the positive predictive
              value (PPV) of hospitalization and emergency department encounter
              diagnoses in identifying SD/VA events originating in the
              outpatient setting. METHODS: We selected random samples of
              hospitalizations and emergency department claims with principal
              or first-listed discharge diagnosis codes indicative of SD/VA in
              individuals contributing at least 6 months of baseline time
              within 1999-2002 Medicaid and Medicare data from five large
              states. We then obtained and reviewed medical records
              corresponding to these events to serve as the reference standard.
              RESULTS: We identified 5239 inpatient and 29 135 emergency
              department events, randomly selected 100 of each, and obtained
              119 medical records, 116 of which were for the requested courses
              of care. The PPVs for an outpatient-originating SD/VA
              precipitating hospitalization or emergency department treatment
              were 85.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 77.6-91.2) overall,
              79.7\% (95\%CI = 68.3-88.4) for hospitalization claims, and
              93.6\% (95\%CI = 82.5-98.7) for emergency department claims.
              CONCLUSIONS: First-listed SD/VA diagnostic codes identified in
              inpatient or emergency department encounters had very good
              agreement with clinical diagnoses and functioned well to identify
              outpatient-originating events. Researchers using such codes can
              be confident of the PPV when conducting studies of SD/VA
              originating in the outpatient setting.",

              is attributable to recurrent, not de novo metastatic disease, yet
              we know relatively little about these patients. To fill this gap,
              investigators often use administrative codes for secondary
              malignant neoplasm or chemotherapy to identify recurrent cases in
              population-based datasets. However, these algorithms have not
              been validated in large, contemporary, routine care cohorts.
              OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity of secondary malignant
              neoplasm and chemotherapy codes as indicators of recurrence after
              definitive local therapy for stage I-III lung, colorectal,
              breast, and prostate cancer. RESEARCH DESIGN, SUBJECTS, AND
              MEASURES: We assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and positive
              predictive value (PPV) of these codes 14 and 60 months after
              diagnosis using 2 administrative datasets linked with
              gold-standard recurrence status information: CanCORS/Medicare
              (diagnoses 2003-2005) and HMO/Cancer Research Network (diagnoses
              2000-2005). RESULTS: We identified 929 CanCORS/Medicare patients
              and 5298 HMO/CRN patients. Sensitivity, specificity, and PPV
              ranged widely depending on which codes were included and the type
              of cancer. For patients with lung, colorectal, and breast cancer,
              the combination of secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy
              codes was the most sensitive (75\%-85\%); no code-set was highly
              sensitive and highly specific. For prostate cancer, no code-set
              offered even moderate sensitivity (</= 19\%). CONCLUSIONS:
              Secondary malignant neoplasm and chemotherapy codes could not
              identify recurrent cancer without some risk of misclassification.
              Findings based on existing algorithms should be interpreted with
              caution. More work is needed to develop a valid algorithm that
              can be used to characterize outcomes and define patient cohorts

              approximately 800,000 members from 4 managed care plans, we
              identified patients who had at least 2 ambulatory claims for a
              diagnosis of gout between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2003.
              From this group, a random sample of 200 patients was chosen for
              medical record review. Trained medical record reviewers
              abstracted gout-related clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data
              from the medical records. Two rheumatologists independently
              evaluated the abstracted information and assessed whether the
              gout diagnosis was probable/definite or unlikely/insufficient
              information. Discordant physician ratings were adjudicated by
              consensus. Based on record reviews, patients were also classified
              according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), Rome,

              consensus, leading to a positive predictive value of >or=2 coded

              administrative data alone in epidemiologic and health services
              research on gout may lead to misclassification. Medical record

              patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Patients with
              claims for moderate-to-severe RA (ICD-9 code 714.x) treated with
              disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs as well as controls without
              RA matched for age, gender and time in plan were selected from
              the MarketScan Research Database. Anaemia was identified by ICD-9

              and 95\% confidence interval (CI) for anaemia among RA patients
              versus controls were estimated. Overall disease burden was
              measured using the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI). RESULTS:
              The prevalence ratio for anaemia in RA patients was 2.2 (95\% CI
              2.1-2.4). Mean ECI was higher in RA (2.26) compared with control
              (1.02) patients (p<0.001), and RA patients with anaemia had a
              higher ECI compared with those without anaemia (3.95 vs. 2.08;

              approximately twice those of RA patients without anaemia.
              CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of clinically diagnosed anaemia in RA
              patients in the claims database was 2.2 times higher than that in
              the comparable non-RA control group. RA patients with anaemia had

              cancer outcomes, most registries do not collect critical events
              such as relapse. Attempts to use health administrative data to
              identify these events have focused on older adults and have been
              mostly unsuccessful. We developed and tested administrative
              data-based algorithms in a population-based cohort of adolescents
              and young adults with cancer. METHODS: We identified all Ontario
              adolescents and young adults 15-21 years old diagnosed with
              leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoma, or testicular cancer between
              1992-2012. Chart abstraction determined the end of initial
              treatment (EOIT) date and subsequent cancer-related events
              (progression, relapse, second cancer). Linkage to
              population-based administrative databases identified fee and
              procedure codes indicating cancer treatment or palliative care.
              Algorithms determining EOIT based on a time interval free of
              treatment-associated codes, and new cancer-related events based
              on billing codes, were compared with chart-abstracted data.
              RESULTS: The cohort comprised 1404 patients. Time periods free of
              treatment-associated codes did not validly identify EOIT dates;
              using subsequent codes to identify new cancer events was thus
              associated with low sensitivity (56.2\%). However, using
              administrative data codes that occurred after the EOIT date based
              on chart abstraction, the first cancer-related event was
              identified with excellent validity (sensitivity, 87.0\%;
              specificity, 93.3\%; positive predictive value, 81.5\%; negative
              predictive value, 95.5\%). CONCLUSIONS: Although administrative
              data alone did not validly identify cancer-related events,
              administrative data in combination with chart collected EOIT
              dates was associated with excellent validity. The collection of
              EOIT dates by cancer registries would significantly expand the

              identify AKI events in epidemiologic research. The goals of this
              study were to validate billing code-identified AKI against the
              current AKI consensus definition and to ascertain whether
              sensitivity and specificity vary by patient characteristic or
              over time. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, \& MEASUREMENTS: The
              study population included 10,056 Atherosclerosis Risk in
              Communities study participants hospitalized between 1996 and
              2008. Billing code-identified AKI was compared with the 2012
              Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine-based
              criteria (AKIcr) and an approximation of the 2012 KDIGO
              creatinine- and urine output-based criteria (AKIcr\_uop) in a
              subset with available outpatient data. Sensitivity and
              specificity of billing code-identified AKI were evaluated over
              time and according to patient age, race, sex, diabetes status,
              and CKD status in 546 charts selected for review, with estimates
              adjusted for sampling technique. RESULTS: A total of 34,179
              hospitalizations were identified; 1353 had a billing code for
              AKI. The sensitivity of billing code-identified AKI was 17.2\%
              (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 13.2\% to 21.2\%) compared
              with AKIcr (n=1970 hospitalizations) and 11.7\% (95\% CI, 8.8\%
              to 14.5\%) compared with AKIcr\_uop (n=1839 hospitalizations).
              Specificity was >98\% in both cases. Sensitivity was
              significantly higher in the more recent time period (2002-2008)
              and among participants aged 65 years and older. Billing
              code-identified AKI captured a more severe spectrum of disease
              than did AKIcr and AKIcr\_uop, with a larger proportion of
              patients with stage 3 AKI (34.9\%, 19.7\%, and 11.5\%,
              respectively) and higher in-hospital mortality (41.2\%, 18.7\%,
              and 12.8\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The use of billing codes
              to identify AKI has low sensitivity compared with the current
              KDIGO consensus definition, especially when the urine output
              criterion is included, and results in the identification of a
              more severe phenotype. Epidemiologic studies using billing codes
              may benefit from a high specificity, but the variation in
              sensitivity may result in bias, particularly when trends over
              time are the outcome of interest.",

              ``suspected,'' and brain imaging information were extracted from
              the database. We set the algorithm with the combination of the
              diagnostic code and/or the brain imaging information, and
              manually reviewed the presence or absence of the acute
              cerebrovascular disease with medical charts. RESULTS: A total of
              2654 diagnostic codes, 1991 ``definite'' and 663 ``suspected,''
              were identified. After excluding duplicates, the numbers of
              ``definite'' and ``suspected'' diagnostic codes were 912 and 228,
              respectively. The proportion of the presence of the disease in
              the ``definite'' diagnostic code was 22\%; this raised 51\% with
              the combination of the diagnostic code and the use of brain
              imaging information. When adding the interval of when brain
              imaging was performed (within 30 days and within 1 day) to the
              diagnostic code, the proportion increased to 84\% and 90\%,
              respectively. In the algorithm of ``definite'' diagnostic code,
              history of stroke was the most common in the diagnostic code, but
              in the algorithm of ``definite'' diagnostic code and the use of
              brain imaging within 1 day, stroke mimics was the most frequent.
              CONCLUSIONS: Combining the diagnostic code and clinical
              examination improved the proportion of the presence of disease in
              the diagnostic code and achieved appropriate accuracy for
              research. Clinical research using EMRs require outcome validation
              prior to conducting a study.",

              outpatient medical claims for UGI symptoms among new users of
              celecoxib versus ibuprofen, and naproxen. METHODS: The study was
              conducted using LifeLink, an insurance claims database of
              approximately 1.8 million employees, dependents, and retirees in
              the United States. Patients newly treated with a prescription of
              celecoxib, ibuprofen, or naproxen between June 1, 1999, and June
              30, 2001, were included. A patient with an upper GI (UGI) symptom
              was any individual with an outpatient physician claim for
              dyspepsia (ICD-9 = 536.8), abdominal pain (789.0), or
              nausea/vomiting (787.0). Incidence was determined using
              person-time analysis. Multivariate analyses were conducted using
              Poisson and Cox regression models. RESULTS: The cohort consisted
              of patients prescribed celecoxib (n = 68,939), ibuprofen (n =
              71,456), or naproxen (n = 50,014). At baseline, celecoxib users
              were older and more likely to have a history of UGI or
              cardiovascular conditions. The incidence rate of any UGI symptom
              was 0.46 per 1,000 patient-days for celecoxib, 0.70 for
              ibuprofen, and 0.62 for naproxen. After adjusting for confounding
              factors using Poisson regression, the ibuprofen rate was 48\%
              higher than the celecoxib rate (incidence rate ratio (IRR) =
              1.48; 95\% CI = 1.39-1.58; p < 0.001), whereas the naproxen rate
              was 40\% higher (IRR = 1.40; 95\% CI = 1.31-1.49; p < 0.001). The
              association between drug use and UGI symptoms was confirmed by
              Cox regression analysis; the hazard ratios were 1.21 (95\% CI =
              1.13-1.29; p < 0.001) for ibuprofen and 1.15 (95\% CI =
              1.07-1.23; p < 0.001) for naproxen relative to celecoxib. Younger
              age, female sex, medical history of UGI, cardiovascular and renal
              conditions, and higher baseline average healthcare expenditures
              for the 12-month period preceding the index prescription were
              also significantly associated with an increased incidence of UGI
              symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Celecoxib use is associated with a
              significantly decreased risk of outpatient physician claims for
              UGI symptoms compared with commonly used prescription nonspecific

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Data from centralised, population-based statutory
              cancer registries are generally considered the 'gold standard'
              for confirming incident cases of cancer. When these are not
              available, or more current information is needed, hospital or
              other routinely collected population-level data may be feasible
              alternative sources. We aimed to determine the validity of
              various methods using routinely collected administrative health
              data for ascertaining incident cases of colorectal or lung cancer
              in participants from the 45 and Up Study in New South Wales
              (NSW), Australia. METHODS: For 266,844 participants in the 45 and
              Up Study (recruited 2006-2009) ascertainment of incident
              colorectal or lung cancers was assessed using diagnosis and
              treatment records in linked administrative health datasets
              (hospital, emergency department, Medicare and pharmaceutical
              claims, death records). This was compared with ascertainment via
              the NSW Cancer Registry (NSWCR, the 'gold standard') for a period
              for which both data sources were available for participants.
              RESULTS: A total of 2253 colorectal and 1019 lung cancers were
              recorded for study participants in the NSWCR over the period
              2006-2010. A diagnosis of primary cancer recorded in the
              statewide Admitted Patient Data Collection identified the
              majority of NSWCR colorectal and lung cancers, with sensitivities
              and positive predictive values (PPV) of 95\% and 91\% for
              colorectal cancer and 81\% and 85\% for lung cancer,
              respectively. Using additional information on lung cancer deaths
              from death records increased sensitivity to 84\% (PPV 83\%) for
              lung cancer, but did not improve ascertainment of colorectal
              cancers. Hospital procedure codes for colorectal cancer surgery
              identified cases with sensitivity 81\% and PPV 54\%. No other
              individual indicator had sensitivity >50\% or PPV >65\% for
              either cancer type and no combination of indicators increased
              both the sensitivity and PPV above that achieved using the
              hospital cancer diagnosis data. All specificities were close to
              100\%; 95\% confidence intervals for sensitivity and PPV were
              generally +/-2\%. CONCLUSIONS: In NSW, identifying new cases of
              colorectal and lung cancer from administrative health datasets,
              such as hospital records, is a feasible alternative when cancer
              registry data are not available. However, the strengths and
              limitations of the different data sources should be borne in
              mind.",

              Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)-based algorithms to identify
              patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been
              developed outside of the Veterans Affairs healthcare setting. The
              development and validation of such algorithms are necessary for
              the conduct of population-based studies evaluating the
              epidemiology and comparative effectiveness and safety of
              therapies for HCC. METHODS: We queried electronic medical records
              at two tertiary care hospitals to identify patients with two
              ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for a chronic liver disease and/or
              cirrhosis plus two ICD-9-CM codes for HCC. We determined the
              positive predictive value (PPV) of this algorithm by comparing it
              to diagnoses of HCC confirmed by expert medical record review.
              RESULTS: Among 101 patients meeting the algorithm, 88 (PPV:
              87.1\%; 95\% CI: 79.0-93.0\%) had confirmed HCC. The algorithm's
              sensitivity was 91.7\% among patients with confirmed HCC, and its
              specificity was 98.7\% among chronic liver disease patients
              without HCC. Excluding patients who received systemic
              chemotherapy in the 12 months prior to or 6 months after the
              initial ICD-9-CM code in the algorithm, the PPV increased to
              91.6\% (87/95; 95\% CI: 84.1-96.3\%). CONCLUSIONS: The presence
              of at least two ICD-9-CM codes for a chronic liver disease and/or
              cirrhosis plus two ICD-9-CM codes for HCC has a high PPV for
              identifying HCC cases. This simple, claims-based algorithm can be
              used in future epidemiologic studies to examine risk factors for
              HCC and evaluate outcomes and adverse events of medical therapies
              prescribed for HCC patients.",

              cases were extracted by algorithms based on diagnosis codes,
              keywords, drug prescriptions and results of diagnostic tests. A
              random sample of identified cases was validated by interviewing
              their GPs. SETTING: HSD is a database of primary care medical
              records. A panel of 12 GPs participated in this validation study.
              PARTICIPANTS: 300 patients were sampled for each disease, except

              positive predictive value (PPV) was assessed for the

              the questionnaire, and Cohen's kappa was calculated for agreement

              increased risk of stroke, but their absolute rate of stroke
              depends on age and comorbid conditions. OBJECTIVE: To assess the
              predictive value of classification schemes that estimate stroke
              risk in patients with AF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Two
              existing classification schemes were combined into a new
              stroke-risk scheme, the CHADS( 2) index, and all 3 classification
              schemes were validated. The CHADS( 2) was formed by assigning 1
              point each for the presence of congestive heart failure,
              hypertension, age 75 years or older, and diabetes mellitus and by
              assigning 2 points for history of stroke or transient ischemic
              attack. Data from peer review organizations representing 7 states
              were used to assemble a National Registry of AF (NRAF) consisting
              of 1733 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 95 years who had
              nonrheumatic AF and were not prescribed warfarin at hospital
              discharge. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hospitalization for ischemic
              stroke, determined by Medicare claims data. RESULTS: During 2121
              patient-years of follow,  94 patients were readmitted to the
              hospital for ischemic stroke (stroke rate, 4.4 per 100
              patient-years). As indicated by a c statistic greater than 0.5,
              the 2 existing classification schemes predicted stroke better
              than chance: c of 0.68 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.71)
              for the scheme developed by the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators
              (AFI) and c of 0.74 (95\% CI, 0.71-0.76) for the Stroke
              Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) III scheme. However,
              with a c statistic of 0.82 (95\% CI, 0.80-0.84), the CHADS( 2)
              index was the most accurate predictor of stroke. The stroke rate
              per 100 patient-years without antithrombotic therapy increased by
              a factor of 1.5 (95\% CI, 1.3-1.7) for each 1-point increase in
              the CHADS( 2) score: 1.9 (95\% CI, 1.2-3.0) for a score of 0; 2.8
              (95\% CI, 2.0-3.8) for 1; 4.0 (95\% CI, 3.1-5.1) for 2; 5.9 (95\%

              8.2-17.5) for 5; and 18.2 (95\% CI, 10.5-27.4) for 6. CONCLUSION:
              The 2 existing classification schemes and especially a new stroke
              risk index, CHADS( 2), can quantify risk of stroke for patients
              who have AF and may aid in selection of antithrombotic therapy.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Electronic health record (EHR) data is increasingly
              used to identify patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). EHR
              queries used to capture CKD status, identify comorbid conditions,
              measure awareness by providers, and track adherence to
              guideline-concordant processes of care have not been validated.
              METHODS: We extracted EHR data for primary-care patients with two
              eGFRcreat 15-59 mL/min/1.73 m^2 at least 90 days apart. Two
              nephrologists manually reviewed a random sample of 50 charts to
              determine CKD status, associated comorbidities, and physician
              awareness of CKD. We also assessed the documentation of a CKD
              diagnosis with guideline-driven care. RESULTS: Complete data were
              available on 1767 patients with query-defined CKD of whom 822
              (47\%) had a CKD diagnosis in their chart. Manual chart review
              confirmed the CKD diagnosis in 34 or 50 (68\%) patients.
              Agreement between the reviewers and the EHR diagnoses on the
              presence of comorbidities was good (kappa > 0.70, p < 0.05),
              except for congestive heart failure, (kappa = 0.45, p < 0.05).
              Reviewers felt the providers were aware of CKD in 23 of 34 (68\%)
              of the confirmed CKD cases. A CKD diagnosis was associated with
              higher odds of guideline-driven care including CKD-specific
              laboratory tests and prescriptions for statins. After adjustment,
              CKD diagnosis documentation was not significantly associated with
              ACE/ARB prescription. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying CKD status by
              historical eGFRs overestimates disease prevalence. A CKD
              diagnosis in the patient chart was a reasonable surrogate for
              provider awareness of disease status, but CKD awareness remains
              relatively low. CKD in the patient chart was associated with
              higher rates of albuminuria testing and use of statins, but not
              use of ACE/ARB.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Prior research conducted on treatment of erectile
              dysfunction (ED) has been derived from surveys involving
              relatively small populations of men. There are needs for large
              population-based studies in this area. Our study addresses that
              need. AIM: The aim of this study was to characterize ED treatment
              among a large population of men. METHODS: Patients >/=30 years in
              commercial insurance dataset with diagnosis code for ED during
              12-month period ending June 2011 were identified. Men were
              considered ``treated'' if prescription was filled for
              phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i), injection or urethral
              prostaglandins, or androgen replacement (ART) during study
              period. ``Untreated'' patients received the diagnosis but did not
              fill prescription. Statistical analyses were used to compare
              prescription frequency with clinical characteristics, including
              age and comorbidities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ED treatment rates
              among large population of insured men, treatment types employed,
              patient demographics, associated medical comorbidities of this
              population, and prescriber details were the main outcome
              measures. RESULTS: Only 25.4\% of 6,228,509 men with ED were
              treated during study period. While PDE5is were the most commonly
              prescribed medical therapy (75.2\%), ART was utilized as
              monotherapy or in combination therapy in 30.6\% of men. ART was
              significantly (P 65 years. Although ED frequency was associated
              with increased age and number of comorbidities, men >60 years
              were significantly (P < 0.0001) less likely to be treated
              compared with men aged 40-59 years. Additionally, treatment
              frequency did not vary as a function of number of comorbidities.
              However, compared with men with prostate cancer, men with
              comorbid hypogonadism, sleep disorders, benign prostatic
              hyperplasia, or components of metabolic syndrome were (P <
              0.0001) more likely to be treated. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high
              prevalence of ED with age and comorbidities, most men continue
              receiving no treatment. Although benefits of medical intervention
              for ED are well-recognized, many barriers to treatment
              continually exist including physician, patient and partner
              preference and knowledge.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major and
              increasing constituent of disease burdens worldwide. Early
              identification of patients at increased risk of developing CKD
              can guide interventions to slow disease progression, initiate
              timely referral to appropriate kidney care services, and support
              targeting of care resources. Risk prediction models can extend
              laboratory-based CKD screening to earlier stages of disease;
              however, to date, only a few of them have been externally
              validated or directly compared outside development populations.
              Our objective was to validate published CKD prediction models
              applicable in primary care. METHODS: We synthesised two recent
              systematic reviews of CKD risk prediction models and externally
              validated selected models for a 5-year horizon of disease onset.
              We used linked, anonymised, structured (coded) primary and
              secondary care data from patients resident in Salford (population
              ~234 k), UK. All adult patients with at least one record in 2009
              were followed-up until the end of 2014, death, or CKD onset (n =
              178,399). CKD onset was defined as repeated impaired eGFR
              measures over a period of at least 3 months, or physician
              diagnosis of CKD Stage 3-5. For each model, we assessed
              discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis.
              RESULTS: Seven relevant CKD risk prediction models were
              identified. Five models also had an associated simplified scoring
              system. All models discriminated well between patients developing
              CKD or not, with c-statistics around 0.90. Most of the models
              were poorly calibrated to our population, substantially
              over-predicting risk. The two models that did not require
              recalibration were also the ones that had the best performance in
              the decision curve analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Included CKD prediction
              models showed good discriminative ability but over-predicted the
              actual 5-year CKD risk in English primary care patients. QKidney,
              the only UK-developed model, outperformed the others. Clinical
              prediction models should be (re)calibrated for their intended
              uses.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Studies that use electronic health
              data typically identify heart failure (HF) events from
              hospitalizations with a principal diagnosis of HF. This approach
              may underestimate the total burden of HF among persons with CKD.
              We assessed the accuracy of algorithms for identifying validated
              HF events from hospitalizations and outpatient encounters, and we
              used this validation information to estimate the rate of HF
              events in a large CKD population. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS,
              \& MEASUREMENTS: We identified a cohort of 15,141 adults age
              18-89 years with an eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) from 2008 to
              2011. Potential HF events during follow-up were randomly sampled
              for validation with medical record review. Positive predictive
              values from the validation study were used to estimate the rate
              of validated HF events in the full cohort. RESULTS: A total of
              1864 participants had at least one health care encounter that
              qualified as a potential HF event during 2.7 years of mean
              follow-up. Among 313 potential events that were randomly sampled
              for validation, positive predictive values were 92\% for
              hospitalizations with a principal diagnosis of HF, 32\% for
              hospitalizations with a secondary diagnosis of HF, and 70\% for
              qualifying outpatient HF encounters. Through use of this
              validation information in the full cohort, the rate of validated
              HF events estimated from the most comprehensive algorithm that
              included principal and secondary diagnosis hospitalizations and
              outpatient encounters was 35.2 events/1000 person-years (95\%
              confidence interval, 33.1 to 37.4), compared with 9.5 events/1000
              person-years (95\% confidence interval, 8.7 to 10.5) from the
              algorithm that included only principal diagnosis
              hospitalizations. Outpatient encounters accounted for 20\% of the
              total number of validated HF events. CONCLUSIONS: In studies that
              rely on electronic health data, algorithms that include
              hospitalizations with a secondary diagnosis of HF and outpatient
              HF encounters more fully capture the burden of HF, although
              validation of HF events may be necessary with this approach.",

              studies of cardiovascular disease in the setting of the Veterans
              Health Administration (VA). Previous studies have estimated the
              positive predictive value (PPV) of International Classification
              of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for acute myocardial
              infarction (MI), but the sensitivity of these codes for all true
              events and the accuracy of coding algorithms for prevalent
              disease status at baseline are largely unknown. METHODS: We
              randomly sampled 180 Veterans from the VA Puget Sound Health Care
              System who initiated diabetes treatment. The full electronic
              medical record was reviewed to identify prevalent conditions at
              baseline and acute MI events during follow-up. The accuracy of
              various coding algorithms was assessed. RESULTS: Algorithms for
              previous acute events at baseline had high PPV (previous MI:
              97\%; previous stroke: 81\%) but low sensitivity (previous MI:
              38\%; previous stroke: 52\%). Algorithms for chronic conditions
              at baseline had high PPV (heart failure: 72\%; coronary heart
              disease [CHD]: 85\%) and high sensitivity (heart failure: 90\%,
              CHD: 84\%). For current smoking status at baseline, ICD-9 codes
              with pharmacy data had a PPV of 77\% and sensitivity of 73\%. The
              coding algorithm for acute MI events during follow-up had high
              PPV (80\%) and sensitivity (89\%). CONCLUSIONS: ICD-9 codes for
              acute MI events during follow-up had high PPV and sensitivity.
              The sensitivity of ICD-9 codes for previous acute events at

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.0 mEq/L) may be
              caused by reduced kidney function and drugs affecting the
              renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and is often present in
              patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: To
              quantify the burden of hyperkalemia in US Medicare
              fee-for-service and commercially insured populations using
              real-world claims data, focusing on prevalence, comorbidities,
              mortality, medical utilization, and cost. METHODS: A descriptive,
              retrospective claims data analysis was performed on patients with
              hyperkalemia using the 2014 Medicare 5\% sample and the 2014
              Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and
              Encounter databases. The starting study samples required patient
              insurance eligibility during >/=1 months in 2014. The
              identification of hyperkalemia and other comorbidities required
              having >/=1 qualifying claims in 2014 with an appropriate
              International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
              Clinical Modification diagnosis code in any position. To address
              the differences between patients with and without hyperkalemia,
              CKD subsamples were analyzed separately. Mortality rates were
              calculated in the Medicare sample population only. The claims
              were grouped into major service categories; the allowed costs
              reflected all costs incurred by each cohort divided by the total
              number of member months for that cohort. RESULTS: The prevalence
              of hyperkalemia in the Medicare and commercially insured samples
              was 2.3\% and 0.09\%, respectively. Hyperkalemia was associated
              with multiple comorbidities, most notably CKD. The prevalence of
              CKD in the Medicare and the commercially insured members with
              hyperkalemia was 64.8\% and 31.8\%, respectively. After adjusting
              for CKD severity, the annual mortality rate for Medicare patients
              with CKD and hyperkalemia was 24.9\% versus 10.4\% in patients
              with CKD without hyperkalemia. The allowed costs in patients with
              CKD and hyperkalemia in the Medicare and commercially insured
              cohorts were more than twice those in patients with CKD without
              hyperkalemia. Inpatient care accounted for >50\% of costs in
              patients with CKD and hyperkalemia. CONCLUSION: Hyperkalemia is

              patients without the code (NPV = 82\%, 95\% CI: 68-91).
              Sensitivity was 84\% (95\% CI: 72-92), and specificity was 98\%
              (95\% CI: 86-99). Establishing goals of care was the most
              frequent reason for palliative care consultation (43\% of the
              sample). CONCLUSION: The ICD-9 code V66.7 identifies specialist
              palliative care for hospitalized patients with HF in the VHA.

              Alberta, Canada despite vaccination programs. Waning immunity
              from existing acellular component vaccines may be contributing to
              this. Vaccine effectiveness can be estimated using a variety of
              data sources including diagnostic codes from physician billing
              claims, public health records, reportable disease and laboratory
              databases. We sought to determine if diagnostic codes from
              billing claims (administrative data) are adequately sensitive and
              specific to identify pertussis cases among patients who had
              undergone disease-specific laboratory testing. METHODS: Data were
              extracted for 2004-2014 from a public health communicable disease
              database that contained data on patients under investigation for
              B. pertussis (both those who had laboratory tests and those who
              were epidemiologically linked to laboratory-confirmed cases) in
              Alberta, Canada. These were deterministically linked using a
              unique lifetime person identifier to the provincial billing
              claims database, which contains International Classification of
              Disease version 9 (ICD-9) diagnostic codes for physician visits.
              We examined visits within 90 days of laboratory testing. ICD-9
              codes 033 (whooping cough), 033.0 (Bordetella pertussis), 033.1
              (B. parapertussis), 033.8 (whooping cough, other specified
              organism), and 033.9 (whooping cough, other unspecified organism)
              in any of the three diagnostic fields for a claim were classified
              as being pertussis-specific codes. We calculated sensitivity,
              specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values.
              RESULTS: We identified 22,883 unique patients under investigation
              for B. pertussis. Of these, 22,095 underwent laboratory testing.
              Among those who had a laboratory test, 2360 tested positive for
              pertussis. The sensitivity of a pertussis-specific ICD-9 code for
              identifying a laboratory-confirmed case was 38.6\%, specificity
              was 76.9\%, PPV was 16.0\%, and NPV was 91.6\%. CONCLUSION: ICD-9
              codes from physician billing claims data have low sensitivity and
              moderate specificity to identify laboratory-confirmed pertussis
              among persons tested for pertussis.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recent progression towards precision
              medicine has encouraged the use of electronic health records
              (EHRs) as a source for large amounts of data, which is required
              for studying the effect of treatments or risk factors in more
              specific subpopulations. Phenotyping algorithms allow to
              automatically classify patients according to their particular
              electronic phenotype thus facilitating the setup of retrospective
              cohorts. Our objective is to compare the performance of different
              classification strategies (only using standardized problems,
              rule-based algorithms, statistical learning algorithms (six
              learners) and stacked generalization (five versions)), for the
              categorization of patients according to their diabetic status
              (diabetics, not diabetics and inconclusive; Diabetes of any type)
              using information extracted from EHRs. METHODS: Patient
              information was extracted from the EHR at Hospital Italiano de
              Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina. For the derivation and
              validation datasets, two probabilistic samples of patients from
              different years (2005: n=1663; 2015: n=800) were extracted. The
              only inclusion criterion was age (>/=40 \& <80 years). Four
              researchers manually reviewed all records and classified patients
              according to their diabetic status (diabetic: diabetes registered
              as a health problem or fulfilling the ADA criteria; non-diabetic:
              not fulfilling the ADA criteria and having at least one fasting
              glycemia below 126mg/dL; inconclusive: no data regarding their
              diabetic status or only one abnormal value). The best performing
              algorithms within each strategy were tested on the validation
              set. RESULTS: The standardized codes algorithm achieved a Kappa
              coefficient value of 0.59 (95\% CI 0.49, 0.59) in the validation
              set. The Boolean logic algorithm reached 0.82 (95\% CI 0.76,
              0.88). A slightly higher value was achieved by the Feedforward
              Neural Network (0.9, 95\% CI 0.85, 0.94). The best performing
              learner was the stacked generalization meta-learner that reached
              a Kappa coefficient value of 0.95 (95\% CI 0.91, 0.98).
              CONCLUSIONS: The stacked generalization strategy and the
              feedforward neural network showed the best classification metrics
              in the validation set. The implementation of these algorithms

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Histopathologic studies have implicated herpes zoster
              (HZ) as a causative organism of giant cell arteritis (GCA). The
              purpose of this study was to assess the epidemiologic association
              of HZ events with incident GCA. METHODS: We performed a
              retrospective cohort study in 2 large independent US
              administrative data sets: Medicare 5\% and Truven Health
              Analytics MarketScan. Eligible subjects had 12 months of
              continuous coverage, were >50 years old, and had no history of
              GCA or polymyalgia rheumatica. HZ events (complicated and
              uncomplicated) and GCA were identified by the presence of
              International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
              Clinical Modification codes from physician visit or hospital
              discharge records. Antiviral therapies and vaccinations were
              identified from prescription claims and drug codes. Risk of
              incident GCA was calculated using multivariable Cox proportional
              hazards regression. RESULTS: Among 16,686,345 subjects, a total
              of 5,942 GCA cases occurred, with 3.1\% (MarketScan) and 6.0\%
              (Medicare) having preceding HZ events. Unadjusted GCA incidence
              rates were highest in the groups with complicated and
              uncomplicated HZ. After multivariable adjustment, complicated HZ
              was associated with an increased risk of GCA (hazard ratio [HR]
              1.99 [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.32-3.02] in the
              Medicare cohort and 2.16 [95\% CI 1.46-3.18] in the MarketScan
              cohort), as was uncomplicated HZ (HR 1.42 [95\% CI 1.02-1.99] and
              HR 1.45 [95\% CI 1.05-2.01] in the respective cohorts).
              Vaccination and antiviral treatment were not consistently
              associated with GCA risk, although antiviral treatment was
              marginally associated with a decreased risk of GCA in the
              Medicare cohort (HR 0.67 [95\% CI 0.46-0.99]). CONCLUSION: HZ is
              associated with an increased risk of GCA. The infrequency of HZ
              in GCA patients suggests that it is only one potential trigger
              for GCA. Antivirals and vaccination did not consistently mitigate
              this risk.",

              records as the ``gold standard'' in a large, commercially insured
              US population. METHODS: Patients with >1 medical claim with the
              International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
              Clinical Modification code 695.1x between 1 July 2000 and 31 May

              Database(SM) , which contains administrative claims data for 14
              commercial health insurance plans. Trained nurses and pharmacists
              abstracted pertinent information from the identified patients'
              medical records, which were then reviewed by two independent
              dermatologists to identify criteria to determine SJS diagnosis.
              Positive predictive values (PPVs) based on the claims and chart
              data were computed for all the cases. RESULTS: Medical charts for
              200 claims-identified cases, with the International
              Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
              code 695.1x, were abstracted and reviewed by the dermatologists.
              A total of five cases (PPV = 2.50\%, 95\%CI = 0.8\%-5.7\%) were
              determined to be SJS with clinical certainty. PPVs varied with
              data stratification: PPV for inpatient claims only (PPV = 2.00\%,
              95\%CI = 0.24\%-7.04\%), inpatient claims with 695.1x in first
              diagnosis field (PPV = 4.11\%, 95\%CI = 0.86\%-11.54\%), and
              final decisions of either clinical certainty or probable cases of
              SJS (PPV = 6.00\%, 95\%CI = 3.14\%-10.25\%). CONCLUSION: These
              findings demonstrate the difficulties associated with identifying
              rare disorders, which lack specific diagnostic criteria, within

              general practices in the General Practice Research Database
              (GPRD) that consented to CR linkage. CR and primary care records
              were compared for cancer diagnosis, date of cancer diagnosis and
              death. Read and ICD cancer code sets were reviewed and agreed by
              two authors. RESULTS: There were 5216 (91\% of CR total) cancer
              events diagnosed in both sources. There were 494 (9\%) diagnosed
              in CR only and 213 (4\%) that were diagnosed in GPRD only. The
              predictive value of a GPRD cancer diagnosis was 96\% for lung
              cancer, 92\% for urinary tract cancer, 96\% for
              gastro-oesophageal cancer and 98\% for colorectal cancer. 'False

              registration end dates being shortly before cancer diagnosis
              dates. The date of cancer diagnosis was median 11 (interquartile

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between exenatide BID use
              and acute pancreatitis across two claims-based studies. RESEARCH
              DESIGN AND METHODS: We pooled two cohort studies within separate
              commercial health insurance databases. We included initiators of
              exenatide BID and all other antihyperglycemic drugs without prior
              pancreatitis from 2005-2008. Poisson regression models provided
              rate ratios (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of the
              association of exenatide BID with acute pancreatitis adjusted for
              quintiles of propensity scores. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary
              inpatient diagnoses of acute pancreatitis with correction for
              misclassification via a validation sub-study. RESULTS: There were
              49,956 initiators of exenatide BID and 692,333 initiators of
              other antihyperglycemic drugs. Patients in the two studies were
              similar on many demographic and clinical characteristics.
              Exenatide BID initiators had a higher prevalence of diagnoses
              consistent with diabetes complications (e.g. peripheral
              neuropathy) and cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. hypertension).
              In both studies, current exenatide BID use was not associated
              with uncorrected outcomes of acute pancreatitis (pooled RR 1.0;
              CI 0.8-1.3). PPV correction resulted in a slightly higher point
              estimate for current use (pooled RR 1.3; CI 1.0-1.7) and past use
              (pooled RR 1.6; 95\% CI 1.2-2.1). CONCLUSIONS: These data are
              consistent with little or no higher risk of acute pancreatitis
              associated with current exenatide BID use relative to nonuse.
              Although previous work identified non-causal mechanisms, an
              increased incidence of acute pancreatitis following cessation of
              treatment remains a possibility. Bias due to residual confounding
              or outcome misclassification may remain, and should be considered
              a potential explanation for these findings.",

              claims for acute pancreatitis among initiators of
              antihyperglycemic drugs in commercial health insurance claims
              data. METHODS: As part of a systematic study of the occurrence of
              acute pancreatitis among antihyperglycemic drug initiators
              (N=260,255) within a large US health insurer's claims database,
              we identified potential cases of acute pancreatitis and confirmed
              them through medical record review. Potential cases had an
              International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision diagnosis
              code for acute pancreatitis (577.0) associated with an inpatient
              or emergency department claim. We sought 860 medical records to
              confirm potential cases and received 585 (70\%), which were
              reviewed by a clinical adjudication committee. We estimated the
              PPV and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) of claims for these
              medical records and a subset that had the diagnosis code listed
              in the first position of an inpatient claim. RESULTS: The PPV was
              0.50 (95\% CI 0.44-0.53) for an acute pancreatitis diagnosis code
              in any position and 0.60 (95\% CI 0.55-0.65) if in the first
              position of an inpatient claim. The estimated PPV varied across
              strata defined by patient characteristics and was generally lower
              within strata where potential risk factors for acute pancreatitis
              were present. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that health
              insurance claims-based identification of acute pancreatitis might
              overestimate actual cases and introduce appreciable bias, usually
              toward the null. Further case confirmation or relative risk
              correction may be necessary to address potential bias.",

              event (AE) crude rates and costs associated with ITP treatments
              as found in claims data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective
              claims-based analysis was conducted using IMS Pharmetrics Plus
              database. Included patients were >/=18 years old, with a
              diagnosis of ITP (2007-2012); an ITP-related claim for anti-D,
              intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), rituximab, romiplostim, or
              eltrombopag; and 1-year continuous enrollment (3-years for
              rituximab) during follow-up. AEs and event costs were identified
              during active treatment, defined from the first claim of each
              drug to a pre-defined treatment gap or end of study period.
              Descriptive statistics were reported with Wilcoxon rank-sum
              significance tests. RESULTS: A total of 2,518 patients were
              identified (mean age = 50.8 (+/-16.3 years); 55.8\% male). Of all
              patients, 22.8\% experienced any AE. Significantly fewer anti-D
              patients had any AE (13.8\% vs IVIG: 21.1\%, rituximab: 29.4\%,
              romiplostim: 28.1\%, eltrombopag: 22.4\%). Nausea/vomiting and
              arthralgia/musculoskeletal pain were most common across
              treatments, and hemolytic events did not differ significantly
              across treatments. Most costly AEs were urinary tract infection,
              aseptic meningitis, and fever ($5000+/case); headache, nasal
              congestion, and hemolytic event were $4,000-5,000/case. Cost per
              AE did not differ by treatment. LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS:
              Although lower than trial-based AE rates, claims for ITP
              treatment-related AEs are common, with higher numbers for
              rituximab and lower numbers for anti-D. This disparity suggests a

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Because the collection of mental health information
              through interviews is expensive and time consuming, interest in
              using population-based administrative health data to conduct
              research on depression has increased. However, there is concern
              that misclassification of disease diagnosis in the underlying
              data might bias the results. Our objective was to determine the
              validity of International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 and
              ICD-10 administrative health data case definitions for depression
              using review of family physician (FP) charts as the reference
              standard. METHODS: Trained chart reviewers reviewed 3362 randomly
              selected charts from years 2001 and 2004 at 64 FP clinics in
              Alberta (AB) and British Columbia (BC), Canada. Depression was
              defined as presence of either: 1) documentation of major
              depressive episode, or 2) documentation of specific
              antidepressant medication prescription plus recorded depressed
              mood. The charts were linked to administrative data (hospital
              discharge abstracts and physician claims data) using personal
              health numbers. Validity indices were estimated for six
              administrative data definitions of depression using three years
              of administrative data. RESULTS: Depression prevalence by chart
              review was 15.9-19.2\% depending on year, region, and province.
              An ICD administrative data definition of '2 depression claims
              with depression ICD codes within a one-year window OR 1 discharge
              abstract data (DAD) depression diagnosis' had the highest overall
              validity, with estimates being 61.4\% for sensitivity, 94.3\% for
              specificity, 69.7\% for positive predictive value, and 92.0\% for
              negative predictive value. Stratification of the validity
              parameters for this case definition showed that sensitivity was
              fairly consistent across groups, however the positive predictive
              value was significantly higher in 2004 data compared to 2001 data
              (78.8 and 59.6\%, respectively), and in AB data compared to BC
              data (79.8 and 61.7\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity of
              the case definition is often moderate, and specificity is often
              high, possibly due to undercoding of depression. Limitations to
              this study include the use of FP charts data as the reference
              standard, given the potential for missed or incorrect depression
              diagnoses. These results suggest that that administrative data
              can be used as a source of information for both research and
              surveillance purposes, while remaining aware of these
              limitations.",

              and mediates outcomes for many chronic diseases. Ability to
              accurately identify and monitor this condition, at the local
              level, is often limited to estimates from national surveys. This
              study sought to compare and validate electronic health record
              (EHR)-based depression surveillance with multiple data sources
              for more granular demographic subgroup and subcounty
              measurements. DESIGN/SETTING: A survey compared data sources for
              the ability to provide subcounty (eg, census tract [CT])
              depression prevalence estimates. Using 2011-2012 EHR data from 2
              large health care providers, and American Community Survey data,
              depression rates were estimated by CT for Denver County,
              Colorado. Sociodemographic and geographic (residence) attributes
              were analyzed and described. Spatial analysis assessed for
              clusters of higher or lower depression prevalence. MAIN OUTCOME
              MEASURE(S): Depression prevalence estimates by CT. RESULTS:
              National and local survey-based depression prevalence estimates
              ranged from 7\% to 17\% but were limited to county level.
              Electronic health record data provided subcounty depression
              prevalence estimates by sociodemographic and geographic groups
              (CT range: 5\%-20\%). Overall depression prevalence was 13\%;
              rates were higher for women (16\% vs men 9\%), whites (16\%), and
              increased with age and homeless patients (18\%). Areas of higher
              and lower EHR-based, depression prevalence were identified.
              CONCLUSIONS: Electronic health record-based depression prevalence
              varied by CT, gender, race/ethnicity, age, and living status.
              Electronic health record-based surveillance complements
              traditional methods with greater timeliness and granularity.
              Validation through subcounty-level qualitative or survey
              approaches should assess accuracy and address concerns about EHR
              selection bias. Public health agencies should consider the

              identified and age-standardized cumulative incidences (ACI)
              estimated in administrative data using German cancer registry
              data as a benchmark. METHODS: ACI per 100,000 insured persons for
              breast, prostate and colorectal cancer were estimated using
              BARMER Statutory Health Insurance claims data. Incident cancer
              cases were defined as having an in- or outpatient diagnosis in
              2013, no diagnosis in a lookback period of 1 year and a second
              diagnosis (or death) in a confirmation period of 1 quarter. We
              varied lookback periods from 1 to 7 years, confirmation periods
              from 1 to 4 quarters as well as the definition of confirmatory
              events and compared ACI estimates to cancer registry data.
              RESULTS: ACI were higher for breast (138.7) and prostate (103.6)
              but lower for colorectal cancer (42.1) when compared to cancer
              registries (119.3, 98.0 and 45.5, respectively). Extending the
              lookback period to 7 years reduced ACI to 129.0, 95.1 and 38.3.
              An extended confirmation period of 4 quarters increased ACI to
              151.3, 114.9 and 46.8. Including breast and colorectal surgeries
              as a confirmatory event reduced ACI to 114.9 and 37.1,

              confirmation periods and the definition of confirmatory events
              have considerable impact on the number of incident cancer cases
              identified and ACI estimated. Researchers need to be aware of
              potential misclassification when identifying incident cancer
              cases in administrative data. Further validation studies as well
              as studies using administrative data to estimate cancer
              incidences should consider several choices of the lookback and
              confirmation periods and the definition of confirmatory events to

              and 2013 in New South Wales, Australia. METHODS: The sensitivity
              and positive predictive value (PPV) of pancreatic and
              periampullary cancer case ascertainment from hospital admission
              data were calculated for the 2005-2009 period through comparison
              with registry data. We examined the effect of the look-back
              period to distinguish incident cancer cases from prevalent cancer
              cases from hospital admission data using 2009 and 2013 as index
              years. RESULTS: Sensitivity of case ascertainment from the
              hospital data was 87.5\% (4322/4939), with higher sensitivity
              when the cancer was resected (97.9\%, 715/730) and for pancreatic
              cancers (88.6\%, 3733/4211). Sensitivity was lower in regional
              (83.3\%) and remote (85.7\%) areas, particularly in areas with
              interstate outflow of patients for treatment, and for cases
              notified to the registry by death certificate only (9.6\%). The
              PPV for the identification of incident cases was 82.0\%
              (4322/5272). A 2-year look-back period distinguished the majority
              (98\%) of incident cases from prevalent cases in linked hospital
              data. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic and periampullary cancer cases and
              resection use can be ascertained from linked hospital admission
              data with sufficient validity for informing aspects of health
              service delivery and system-level monitoring. Limited tumour
              clinical information and variation in case ascertainment across
              population subgroups are limitations of hospital-derived cancer
              incidence data when compared with population cancer registries.",

              There is a need for a claims-based prediction rule that
              payers/hospitals can use to risk stratify PE patients. We sought
              to validate the In-hospital Mortality for PulmonAry embolism
              using Claims daTa (IMPACT) prediction rule for in-hospital and
              30-day outcomes. METHODS: We used the Optum Research Database
              from 1/2008-3/2015 and included adults hospitalized for PE
              (415.1x in the primary position or secondary position when
              accompanied by a primary code for a PE complication) and having
              continuous medical and prescription coverage for >/=6-months
              prior and 3-months post-inclusion or until death. In-hospital and
              30-day mortality and 30-day complications (recurrent venous
              thromboembolism, rehospitalization or death) were assessed and
              prognostic accuracies of IMPACT with 95 \% confidence intervals
              (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 47,531 PE patients were
              included. In-hospital and 30-day mortality occurred in 7.9 and
              9.4 \% of patients and 20.8 \% experienced any complication
              within 30-days. Of the 19.5 \% of patients classified as low-risk
              by IMPACT, 2.0 \% died in-hospital, resulting in a sensitivity
              and specificity of 95.2 \% (95 \% CI, 94.4-95.8) and 20.7 \% (95
              \% CI, 20.4-21.1). Only 1 additional low-risk patient died within
              30-days of admission and 12.2 \% experienced a complication,
              translating into a sensitivity and specificity of 95.9 \% (95 \%
              CI, 95.3-96.5) and 21.1 \% (95 \% CI, 20.7-21.5) for mortality

              algorithms used to identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis
              (RA) in administrative and claim databases. METHODS: We searched
              the MEDLINE database from 1991 to September 2012 using controlled
              vocabulary and key terms related to RA and reference lists of
              included studies were searched. Two investigators independently
              assessed the full text of studies against pre-determined
              inclusion criteria and extracted the data. Data collected
              included participant and algorithm characteristics. RESULTS: Nine
              studies reported validation of computer algorithms based on
              International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes with or
              without free-text, medication use, laboratory data and the need
              for a diagnosis by a rheumatologist. These studies yielded
              positive predictive values (PPV) ranging from 34 to 97\% to
              identify patients with RA. Higher PPVs were obtained with the use
              of at least two ICD and/or procedure codes (ICD-9 code 714 and
              others), the requirement of a prescription of a medication used
              to treat RA, or requirement of participation of a rheumatologist
              in patient care. For example, the PPV increased from 66 to 97\%
              when the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and the
              presence of a positive rheumatoid factor were required.
              CONCLUSIONS: There have been substantial efforts to propose and
              validate algorithms to identify patients with RA in automated
              databases. Algorithms that include more than one code and
              incorporate medications or laboratory data and/or required a

              nonselective alpha1 antagonists such as terazosin, doxazosin, and
              prazosin results in blood pressure reduction due to vasodilation.
              OBJECTIVE: Using claims data from a large Medigap plan, we
              examined the effect of initiating nonselective alpha1-antagonist
              therapy on the incidence of hypotension-related adverse events
              likely to be associated with vascular alpha-adrenoreceptor
              antagonism in patients with BPH. METHODS: Medical and
              prescription claims data were obtained from the MEDSTAT Group for
              53,824 men with a diagnosis code for BPH during the study period
              (January 1995-December 1997). We examined the rate of possible
              hypotension-related adverse events (diagnosis codes for
              hypotension, syncope, dizziness, fractures, and other injuries)
              per 10,000 person-days for men who began therapy with alpha1
              antagonists and for a random sample of nonusers, stratified by
              prior use of other antihypertensive agents. RESULTS: After
              adjusting for baseline differences in event rates, those who
              initiated alpha1-antagonist therapy (n = 1564) had a
              significantly greater increase in hypotension-related
              adverse-event rates in the 4 months after initiation (vs the 4
              months before initiation) than randomly selected nonusers (n =
              8641) (increase of 1.82 vs decrease of 0.02 events per 10,000
              person-days among those not taking antihypertensive agents;
              increase of 0.94 vs 0.69 events per 10,000 person-days among
              those taking other antihypertensive agents; P < 0.01). This
              increase began earlier and lasted longer among patients taking
              other antihypertensive agents. Those who discontinued their
              alpha1 antagonist had a higher rate of hypotensive events at
              baseline than those who did not (5.09 vs 3.19 events per 10,000
              person-days among those using other antihypertensive agents; 3.62
              vs 2.27 events per 10,000 person-days among those not using other
              antihypertensive agents; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of
              nonselective alpha1-antagonist therapy for the treatment of BPH
              increases the risk of a cluster of clinical events consistent
              with vascular alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonism. This effect is
              seen during a 4-month period around the initiation date. Prior
              initiation of other antihypertensive medication increases this
              effect. Urologists should consult with a patient's primary care
              physician about use of other antihypertensive agents before
              initiating nonselective alpha1-antagonist therapy for BPH.",

              validate an ICD-9-CM-based algorithm for identification of
              patients with CIU/CSU and thus facilitate claims-based research.
              METHODS: Patient records were reviewed at 4 US practices.
              Patients included in the study were from a random sample of those
              identified by their physician as having CIU/CSU or because they
              met the following diagnosis-based algorithm: (1) at least 2
              outpatient ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes 708.1, 708.8, or 708.9 at
              least 6 weeks apart or (2) 1 outpatient diagnosis of 708.1,
              708.8, or 708.9 and 1 diagnosis of 995.1 at least 6 weeks apart.
              Data collected included ICD-9-CM codes, diagnoses of urticaria
              and allergy-related conditions, and medication use. Sensitivity
              and positive predictive value were calculated. The study was
              approved by the Western Institutional Review Board. RESULTS: One
              hundred forty-nine patient records were reviewed (mean age 41.1
              years; 73.8\% were women; 69.1\% were white): 115 were identified
              with the diagnosis-based algorithm, 90 were patients with ``known
              CIU/CSU'', and 56 were in the 2 groups. The mean duration of
              CIU/CSU was 2.9 to 3.1 years. The 2 cohorts most frequently had
              diagnoses of idiopathic urticaria, unspecified urticaria, and
              other specified urticaria. The diagnosis-based algorithm had a
              positive predictive value of 90.4\% and a sensitivity of 71.1\%.
              CONCLUSION: The high positive predictive value suggests that
              patients identified using the algorithm are highly likely to have
              CIU/CSU. The 71.1\% sensitivity suggests that most patients with
              CIU/CSU will be identified. The validation statistics support the
              use of the diagnosis-based algorithm in claims-based research,
              although future studies could refine the algorithm further.",

              incidence and severity of acute pancreatitis (AP) in patients
              with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis and whether the
              dialysis modality [hemodialysis (HD) versus peritoneal dialysis
              (PD)] confers a higher risk for AP as well as complications or
              mortality related to AP. Methods: We analyzed national health
              insurance claims data of 67 078 ESRD patients initiating dialysis
              between 1999 and 2007 in Taiwan. All patients were followed up
              from the start of their dialysis to first AP diagnosis, death,
              end of dialysis or 31 December 2008. Cox proportional hazards
              models were used to identify risk factors. Results: The
              cumulative incidence rates of AP were 0.6, 1.7, 2.6, 3.4 and 4\%
              at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 years, respectively. ESRD patients on HD and
              PD had an AP incidence of 5.11 and 5.86 per 1000 person-years,
              respectively. Independent risk factors for AP in this population
              were being elderly, being female, having biliary stones or liver
              disease, and being on PD. Severe AP occurred in 44.9\% of the HD
              patients and in 36\% of the PD patients. Patients with AP on HD
              had a higher incidence of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding
              than those on PD (P = 0.002). In contrast, those with AP on PD
              had a higher incidence of need for total parenteral nutrition
              (TPN) support than those on HD (P = 0.072). Overall in-hospital
              mortality was 8.1\%. The risk factors for mortality after an AP
              attack were male gender, increased age, AP severity, and the
              presence of diabetes mellitus or liver disease. Conclusions: ESRD
              patients on PD were at higher risk for AP than those on HD. HD
              patients with AP attacks had a greater incidence of UGI bleeding

              was 8.1\% among clinic charts. The coding algorithm of ``2
              physician claims within 2 years or 1 hospitalization with the
              relevant diabetes ICD codes'' had higher validity than other 7
              algorithms assessed (sensitivity 92.3\%, specificity 96.9\%,
              positive predictive value 77.2\%, and negative predictive value
              99.3\%). After adjustment for age, sex, and comorbid conditions,
              sensitivity and positive predictive values were not significantly
              different between time periods and regions. CONCLUSION: Diabetes
              could be accurately identified in administrative data using the
              following case definition ``2 physician claims within 2 years or
              1 hospital discharge abstract record with diagnosis codes 250.xx

  abstract = "The introduction of pertussis vaccination in the United States
              (US) in the 1940s has greatly reduced its burden. However, the
              incidence of pertussis is difficult to quantify, as many cases
              are not laboratory-confirmed or reported, particularly in adults.
              This study estimated pertussis incidence in a commercially
              insured US population aged <50 years. Data were extracted from
              IMS' PharMetrics Plus claims database for patients with a
              diagnosis of pertussis or cough illness using International
              Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, a commercial outpatient
              laboratory database for patients with a pertussis laboratory
              test, and the Centers for Disease Control influenza surveillance
              database. US national pertussis incidence was projected using 3
              methods: (1) diagnosed pertussis, defined as a claim for
              pertussis (ICD-9 033.0, 033.9, 484.3) during 2008-2013; (2) based
              on proxy pertussis predictive logistic regression models; (3)
              using the fraction of cough illness (ICD-9 033.0, 033.9, 484.3,
              786.2, 466.0, 466.1, 487.1) attributed to laboratory-confirmed
              pertussis, estimated by time series linear regression models.
              Method 1 gave a projected annual incidence of diagnosed pertussis
              of 9/100,000, which was highest in those aged <1 year. Method 2
              gave an average annual projected incidence of 21/100,000. Method
              3 gave an overall regression-estimated weighted annual incidence
              of pertussis of 649/100,000, approximately 58-93 times higher
              than method 1 depending on the year. These estimations, which are
              consistent with considerable underreporting of pertussis in
              people aged <50 years and provide further evidence that the
              majority of cases go undetected, especially with increasing age,

              causality assessment algorithm to identify drug-induced liver
              injury. METHODS: The Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method
              (RUCAM) is an algorithm for determining the causal association
              between a drug and liver injury. In collaboration with hepatology
              experts, definitions were developed for the RUCAM criteria to
              operationalize an electronic RUCAM (eRUCAM). The eRUCAM was
              tested in a population of patients taking 14 drugs with a
              characteristic phenotype for liver injury. Quality assurance for
              programming specifications involved comparisons between scores
              generated by the eRUCAM, for probable and highly probable cases,
              and expert manual RUCAM (n = 20). Concordance between eRUCAM and
              manual RUCAM subscores and total score was tested using the
              Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: Causality scores were the
              same for 6 of 20 patients (30\%) by manual and eRUCAM algorithms.
              Analysis of subscores revealed >/=80\% concordance between manual
              and eRUCAM for five of the seven criteria. In general, the total
              scores tended to be higher for the eRUCAM compared with the
              manual RUCAM. Programming issues were identified for criterion 5
              'non-drug causes of liver injury' where significant differences
              existed between manual and eRUCAM scoring (p = 0.001). For
              criterion 5, identical scores occurred in 9 of 20 patients
              (45\%), and manual review identified additional codes, timing
              criteria, and laboratory results for improving subsequent eRUCAM
              revisions. CONCLUSION: The eRUCAM had generally good concordance
              with manual RUCAM scoring. These preliminary findings suggest
              that the eRUCAM algorithm is feasible and could have application

              with CKD were selected based on a reduced estimated glomerular
              filtration rate and their notes extracted from the Columbia
              University data warehouse. Two lexical-based classification tools
              (classifier and word-counter) were developed to identify
              documentation of CKD in electronic notes. MEASUREMENTS: The tools
              categorized patients' individual notes on the basis of the
              presence of CKD-related terms. Patients were categorized as
              appropriately documented if their notes contained reference to
              CKD when CKD was present. RESULTS: The sensitivities of the
              classifier and word-count methods were 95.4\% and 99.8\%,
              respectively. The specificity of both was 99.8\%. Categorization
              of individual patients as appropriately documented was 96.9\%
              accurate. Of 107 patients with manually verified moderate CKD, 32
              (22\%) lacked appropriate documentation. Patients whose CKD had
              not been appropriately documented were significantly less likely
              to be on renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or have urine
              protein quantified, and had the illness for half as long (15.1 vs

              CKD is present in a EHR. Using this method, we demonstrated
              under-documentation of patients with moderate CKD.
              Under-documented patients were less likely to receive CKD

              implementing these definitions in claims databases can be
              challenging. We built a data-driven TRD definition and evaluated
              its performance. METHODS: We included adults with depression,
              >/=1 antidepressant, and no diagnosis of mania, dementia, or
              psychosis. Subjects were stratified into those with and without
              proxy for TRD. Proxies for TRD were electroconvulsive therapy,
              deep brain, or vagus nerve stimulation. The index date for
              subjects with proxy for TRD was the procedure date, and for
              subjects without, the date of a randomly selected visit. We used
              three databases. We fit decision tree predictive models. We
              included number of distinct antidepressants, with and without
              adequate doses and duration, number of antipsychotics and
              psychotherapies, and expert-based definitions, 3, 6, and 12
              months before index date. To assess performance, we calculated
              area under the curve (AUC) and transportability. RESULTS: We
              analyzed 33,336 subjects with no proxy for TRD, and 3,566 with
              the proxy. Number of antidepressants and antipsychotics were
              selected in all periods. The best model was at 12 months with an
              AUC = 0.81. The rule transported well and states that a subject
              with >/=1 antipsychotic or >/=3 antidepressants in the last year
              has TRD. Applying this rule, 15.8\% of subjects treated for
              depression had TRD. CONCLUSION: The definition that best
              discriminates between subjects with and without TRD considers

              in THIN ascertained following manual review were validated
              against two data sources deemed gold standards: (i)
              questionnaires sent to primary care practitioners (PCPs; for a

              Classification of Diseases-10 codes related to CRC in HES.
              RESULTS: Of 3805 CRC cases identified in THIN via Read codes,
              3033 patients (80.0\%) were considered definite cases after

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to validate use of electronic
              health records (EHRs) for diagnosing bipolar disorder and
              classifying control subjects. METHOD: EHR data were obtained from
              a health care system of more than 4.6 million patients spanning
              more than 20 years. Experienced clinicians reviewed charts to
              identify text features and coded data consistent or inconsistent
              with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Natural language processing
              was used to train a diagnostic algorithm with 95\% specificity
              for classifying bipolar disorder. Filtered coded data were used
              to derive three additional classification rules for case subjects
              and one for control subjects. The positive predictive value (PPV)
              of EHR-based bipolar disorder and subphenotype diagnoses was
              calculated against diagnoses from direct semistructured
              interviews of 190 patients by trained clinicians blind to EHR
              diagnosis. RESULTS: The PPV of bipolar disorder defined by
              natural language processing was 0.85. Coded classification based
              on strict filtering achieved a value of 0.79, but classifications
              based on less stringent criteria performed less well. No
              EHR-classified control subject received a diagnosis of bipolar
              disorder on the basis of direct interview (PPV=1.0). For most
              subphenotypes, values exceeded 0.80. The EHR-based
              classifications were used to accrue 4,500 bipolar disorder cases
              and 5,000 controls for genetic analyses. CONCLUSIONS:
              Semiautomated mining of EHRs can be used to ascertain bipolar
              disorder patients and control subjects with high specificity and
              predictive value compared with diagnostic interviews. EHRs
              provide a powerful resource for high-throughput phenotyping for

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many different combinations of available data have
              been used to identify gout cases in large genetic studies. The
              aim of this study was to determine the performance of case
              definitions of gout using the limited items available in
              multipurpose cohorts for population-based genetic studies.
              METHODS: This research was conducted using the UK Biobank
              Resource. Data, including genome-wide genotypes, were available
              for 105,421 European participants aged 40-69 years without kidney
              disease. Gout definitions and combinations of these definitions
              were identified from previous epidemiological studies. These
              definitions were tested for association with 30 urate-associated
              single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by logistic regression,
              adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, and ratio of waist
              circumference to height. Heritability estimates under an additive
              model were generated using GCTA version 1.26.0 and PLINK version
              1.90b3.32 by partitioning the genome. RESULTS: There were 2066
              (1.96\%) cases defined by self-report of gout, 1652 (1.57\%)
              defined by urate-lowering therapy (ULT) use, 382 (0.36\%) defined
              by hospital diagnosis, 1861 (1.76\%) defined by hospital
              diagnosis or gout-specific medications and 2295 (2.18\%) defined
              by self-report of gout or ULT use. Association with gout at
              experiment-wide significance (P < 0.0017) was observed for 13
              SNPs with gout using the self-report of gout or ULT use
              definition, 12 SNPs using the self-report of gout definition, 11
              SNPs using the hospital diagnosis or gout-specific medication
              definition, 10 SNPs using ULT use definition and 3 SNPs using
              hospital diagnosis definition. Heritability estimates ranged from
              0.282 to 0.308 for all definitions except hospital diagnosis
              (0.236). CONCLUSIONS: Of the limited items available in
              multipurpose cohorts, the case definition of self-report of gout

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Syndromic surveillance systems are plagued by high
              false-positive rates. In chronic disease monitoring,
              investigators have identified several factors that predict the
              accuracy of case definitions based on diagnoses in administrative
              data, and some have even incorporated these predictors into novel
              case detection methods, resulting in a significant improvement in
              case definition accuracy. Based on findings from these studies,
              we sought to identify physician, patient, encounter, and billing
              characteristics associated with the positive predictive value
              (PPV) of case definitions for 5 syndromes (fever,
              gastrointestinal, neurological, rash, and respiratory (including
              influenza-like illness)). METHODS: The study sample comprised
              4,330 syndrome-positive visits from the claims of 1,098
              randomly-selected physicians working in Quebec, Canada in
              2005-2007. For each visit, physician-facilitated chart review was
              used to assess whether the same syndrome was present in the
              medical chart (gold standard). We used multivariate logistic
              regression analyses to estimate the association between
              claim-chart agreement about the presence of a syndrome and
              physician, patient, encounter, and billing characteristics.
              RESULTS: The likelihood of the medical chart agreeing with the
              physician claim about the presence of a syndrome was higher when
              the treating physician had billed many visits for the same
              syndrome recently (ORper 10 visit, 1.05; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.08), had
              a lower workload (ORper 10 claims, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.90-0.97), and
              when the patient was younger (ORper 5 years of age, 0.96; 95\%

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Psychotherapy is an effective, recommended treatment
              for pediatric anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, individuals with
              mental health conditions often do not receive psychotherapy, with
              variation across provider types. This study sought to examine
              psychotherapy claims surrounding medication initiation in U.S.
              children with diagnosed anxiety disorders. METHODS: The study
              cohort included privately insured children (3-17 years) with a
              diagnosed anxiety disorder initiating a medication to treat
              anxiety from 2004 to 2014. We examined psychotherapy claims in
              the 3 months before and 3 months after medication initiation and
              described children with multiple (2+) psychotherapy claims per
              3-month period. RESULTS: Of the 75,024 children initiating a
              medication for anxiety (median age = 14 years, 58\% female), 35\%
              had multiple psychotherapy claims before medication initiation,
              with variation by age, anxiety disorder, and psychiatric
              comorbidity and with little change across time. Psychotherapy
              claims after medication initiation varied by whether the child
              had prior psychotherapy: 80\% in children with prior
              psychotherapy and 30\% in children without prior psychotherapy
              claims (44\% of children diagnosed by a psychiatrist, 21\% of
              children diagnosed by a pediatrician). CONCLUSION: Many privately
              insured children do not have claims for psychotherapy before or
              after pharmacotherapy initiation for anxiety. Findings can inform
              future research and efforts to ultimately increase appropriate
              psychotherapy utilization in children with anxiety disorders.",

              sensitivity and specificity of myocardial infarction (MI) case
              definitions using multiple discharge code positions and multiple
              diagnosis codes when comparing administrative data to hospital
              surveillance data. METHODS: Hospital surveillance data for ARIC
              Study cohort participants with matching participant ID and
              service dates to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
              hospitalization records for hospitalizations occurring between
              2001 and 2013 were included in this study. Classification of
              Definite or Probable MI from ARIC medical record review defined
              ``gold standard'' comparison for validation measures. In primary
              analyses, an MI was defined with ICD9 code 410 from CMS records.
              Secondary analyses defined MI using code 410 in combination with
              additional codes. RESULTS: A total of 25 549 hospitalization
              records met study criteria. In primary analysis, specificity was
              at least 0.98 for all CMS definitions by discharge code position.
              Sensitivity ranged from 0.48 for primary position only to 0.63
              when definition included any discharge code position. The
              sensitivity of definitions including codes 410 and 411.1 were
              higher than sensitivity observed when using code 410 alone.
              Specificity of these alternate definitions was higher for women
              (0.98) than for men (0.96). CONCLUSION: Algorithms that rely
              exclusively on primary discharge code position will miss
              approximately 50\% of all MI cases due to low sensitivity of this
              definition. We recommend defining MI by code 410 in any of first
              5 discharge code positions overall and by codes 410 and 411.1 in
              any of first 3 positions for sensitivity analyses of women.",

              physician review and adjudication of medical records for
              identifying venous thromboembolism (VTE), and to assess VTE
              incidence, recurrence, and mortality in a large national cohort
              of post-menopausal women followed up to 19years. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: We used detailed clinical data from the Women's Health
              Initiative (WHI) linked to Medicare claims. Agreement between
              data sources was evaluated among 16,003 women during 1993-2010. A
              claims-based definition was selected to analyze VTE occurrence
              and impact among 71,267 women during 1993-2012. RESULTS: Our VTE
              definition had 83\% sensitivity. Positive predictive value was
              69\% when all records were included, and 94\% after limiting
              Medicare records to those with a WHI hospitalization adjudicated.
              Annualized VTE incidence was 4.06/1000person-years (PY),
              recurrence was 5.30/100PY, and both rates varied by
              race/ethnicity. Post-VTE mortality within 1year was 22.49\% from
              all causes, including 1.01\% from pulmonary embolism, 10.40\%
              from cancer, and 11.08\% from other causes. Cancer-related VTE
              compared to non-cancer VTE had significantly (p<0.001) higher
              recurrence (9.86/100PY vs. 4.43/100PY) and mortality from all
              causes (45.89\% vs. 12.28\%), but not from pulmonary embolism
              (0.40\% vs. 1.27\%). CONCLUSIONS: Medicare claims compared
              reasonably well to physician adjudication. The combined data

              syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is not well understood.
              OBJECTIVES: To (a) evaluate total annual all-cause,
              gastrointestinal (GI)-related, and symptom-related (i.e., IBS,
              diarrhea, abdominal pain) health care resource use and costs
              among IBS-D patients in a U.S. commercially insured population
              and (b) estimate incremental all-cause health care costs of IBS-D
              patients versus matched controls. METHODS: Patients aged >/= 18
              years with 12 months of continuous medical and pharmacy benefit
              eligibility in 2013 were identified from the Truven Health
              MarketScan research database. The study sample included patients
              with >/= 1 medical claim with an International Classification of
              Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)
              diagnosis code in any position for IBS (ICD-9-CM 564.1x) and
              either (a) >/= 2 claims for diarrhea (ICD-9-CM 787.91, 564.5x) on
              different service dates in 2013, or (b) >/= 1 claim for diarrhea
              plus >/= 1 claim for abdominal pain (ICD-9-CM 789.0x) on
              different service dates in 2013, or (c) >/= 1 claim for diarrhea
              plus >/= 1 pharmacy claim for a symptom-related prescription on
              different service dates in 2013. Controls included patients with
              no claims for IBS, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or symptom-related
              prescriptions in 2013. Controls were randomly selected and
              matched with IBS-D patients in a 1:1 ratio based on age (+/- 4
              years), gender, geographic location, and health plan type.
              All-cause health care resource utilization included medical and
              pharmacy claims for health care services associated with any
              condition. Total health care costs were defined as the sum of
              health plan-paid and patient-paid direct health care costs from
              prescriptions and medical services, including inpatient,
              emergency department (ED), and physician office visits, and other
              outpatient services. A total cost approach was used to assess
              all-cause, GI-related, and symptom-related health care costs for
              IBS-D patients. An incremental cost approach via generalized
              linear models was used to assess the excess all-cause costs
              attributable to IBS-D after adjusting for demographics and
              general and GI comorbidities. RESULTS: Of 39,306 patients (n =
              19,653 each for IBS-D and matched controls) included, mean (+/-
              SD) age was 47 (+/- 17) years and 76.5\% were female. Compared
              with controls, IBS-D patients had a significantly higher mean
              annual number of hospitalizations, ED visits, office visits, and
              monthly (30-day) prescription fills. Mean annual all-cause health
              care costs for IBS-D patients were $13,038, with over half
              (58.4\%) attributable to office visits and other outpatient
              services (e.g., diagnostic tests and laboratory or radiology
              services), and remaining costs attributable to prescriptions
              (19.5\%), inpatient admissions (13.6\%), and ED visits (8.5\%).
              GI-related ($3,817) and symptom-related ($1,693) costs were also
              primarily driven by other outpatient service costs. After
              adjusting for demographics and comorbidities, incremental annual
              all-cause costs associated with IBS-D were $2,268 ($9,436 for
              IBS-D patients vs. $7,169 for matched controls; P < 0.001) per
              patient/year, of which 78\% were from medical costs and 22\% were
              from prescription costs. CONCLUSIONS: IBS-D was associated with a
              substantial burden in direct costs in this population. Compared
              with matched controls, IBS-D patients had greater medical service
              use and incurred significantly more annual all-cause health care
              costs, even after controlling for demographics and comorbidities.
              Incremental costs associated with IBS-D were primarily
              attributable to increased use of medical services rather than
              pharmacy costs. DISCLOSURES: This study was funded by Allergan.

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Cushing disease (CD) causes a wide variety of
              nonspecific symptoms, which may result in delayed diagnosis. It
              may be possible to uncover unusual combinations of otherwise
              common symptoms using International Classification of Diseases,
              Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Our aim
              was to identify and evaluate dyads of clinical symptoms or
              conditions associated with CD. METHODS: We conducted a matched
              case-control study using a commercial healthcare insurance claims
              database designed to compare the relative risk (RR) of individual
              conditions and dyad combinations of conditions among patients
              with CD versus matched non-CD controls. RESULTS: With expert
              endocrinologist input, we isolated 10 key conditions (localized
              adiposity, hirsutism, facial plethora, polycystic ovary syndrome,
              abnormal weight gain, hypokalemia, deep venous thrombosis, muscle
              weakness, female balding, osteoporosis) with RRs varying from 5.3
              for osteoporosis to 61.0 for hirsutism (and infinite RR for
              localized adiposity). The RRs of dyads of these conditions ranged
              from 4.1 for psychiatric disorders/serious infections to 128.0
              for hirsutism/fatigue in patients with versus without CD.
              Construction of uncommon dyads resulted in further increases in
              RRs beyond single condition analyses; for example, osteoporosis
              alone had an RR of 5.3, which increased to 8.3 with serious
              infections and to 52.0 with obesity. CONCLUSION: This study
              demonstrated that RR of any one of 10 key conditions selected by
              expert opinion was >/=5 times greater in CD compared to non-CD,
              and nearly all dyads had RR>/=5. An uncommon dyad of osteoporosis
              and obesity had an RR of 52.0. If clinicians consider the
              diagnosis of CD when the highest-risk conditions are seen,
              identification of this rare disease may improve.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The retrospective study aimed to estimate prevalence
              of hyperkalemia using a large US commercial claims database.
              METHODS: Adults with serum potassium lab data (2010 to 2014) and
              >/=1 calendar year of data were included from a large US
              commercial claims database. Hyperkalemia was defined as >/=2
              serum potassium measurements >5.0 mEq/L or one hyperkalemia
              diagnosis code (ICD-9-CM, 276.7) or one sodium polystyrene
              sulfonate fill. Hyperkalemia prevalence was estimated for the
              overall population and subgroups with hyperkalemia-related
              comorbidities by calendar year. Hyperkalemia prevalence was also
              standardized to the US population to estimate the number of US
              adults with hyperkalemia. RESULTS: The analysis included
              2,270,635 patients (2010-2014). The annual prevalence of
              hyperkalemia in the overall population was 1.57\% in 2014, with
              higher rates observed in patients with chronic kidney disease
              (CKD), heart failure, diabetes and hypertension. Among patients
              with CKD and/or heart failure, the 2014 annual prevalence was
              6.35\%. Among patients with hyperkalemia, 48.43\% had CKD and/or
              heart failure in 2014. The prevalence of hyperkalemia was higher
              in patients with more severe CKD, as well as older patients and
              men. Extrapolating those results to the US population supports
              that 1.55\% or 3.7 million US adults had hyperkalemia in 2014.
              CONCLUSIONS: An estimated 3.7 million US adults had hyperkalemia
              in 2014, and this prevalence rate has increased since 2010. In
              patients with CKD and/or heart failure, the annual prevalence of
              hyperkalemia was 6.35\% in 2014, and about half of all patients
              with hyperkalemia have either CKD and/or heart failure.",

  abstract = "Medicare claims are commonly used to identify hip fractures, but
              there is no universally accepted definition. We found that a
              definition using inpatient claims identified fewer fractures than
              a definition including outpatient and provider claims. Few
              additional fractures were identified by including inconsistent
              diagnostic and procedural codes at contiguous sites.
              INTRODUCTION: Medicare claims data is commonly used in research
              studies to identify hip fractures, but there is no universally
              accepted definition of fracture. Our purpose was to describe
              potential misclassification when hip fractures are defined using
              Medicare Part A (inpatient) claims without considering Part B
              (outpatient and provider) claims and when inconsistent diagnostic
              and procedural codes occur at contiguous fracture sites (e.g.,
              femoral shaft or pelvic). METHODS: Participants included all
              long-stay nursing home residents enrolled in Medicare Parts A and
              B fee-for-service between 1/1/2008 and 12/31/2009 with follow-up
              through 12/31/2011. We compared the number of hip fractures
              identified using only Part A claims to (1) Part A plus Part B
              claims and (2) Part A and Part B claims plus discordant codes at
              contiguous fracture sites. RESULTS: Among 1,257,279 long-stay
              residents, 40,932 (3.2\%) met the definition of hip fracture
              using Part A claims, and 41,687 residents (3.3\%) met the
              definition using Part B claims. 4566 hip fractures identified
              using Part B claims would not have been captured using Part A
              claims. An additional 227 hip fractures were identified after
              considering contiguous fracture sites. CONCLUSIONS: When
              ascertaining hip fractures, a definition using outpatient and
              provider claims identified 11\% more fractures than a definition
              with only inpatient claims. Future studies should publish their
              definition of fracture and specify if diagnostic codes from
              contiguous fracture sites were used.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: There is little evidence comparing complications after
              intensity-modulated (IMRT) vs. three-dimensional conformal
              radiotherapy (CRT) for prostate cancer. The study objective was
              to test the hypothesis that IMRT, compared with CRT, is
              associated with a reduction in bowel, urinary, and erectile
              complications in elderly men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer.
              METHODS AND MATERIALS: We undertook an observational cohort study
              using registry and administrative claims data from the
              SEER-Medicare database. We identified men aged 65 years or older
              diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the United States
              between 2002 and 2004 who received IMRT (n = 5,845) or CRT (n =
              6,753). The primary outcome was a composite measure of bowel
              complications. Secondary outcomes were composite measures of
              urinary and erectile complications. We also examined specific
              subsets of bowel (proctitis/hemorrhage) and urinary
              (cystitis/hematuria) events within the composite complication
              measures. RESULTS: IMRT was associated with reductions in
              composite bowel complications (24-month cumulative incidence
              18.8\% vs. 22.5\%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.86; 95\% confidence
              interval [CI], 0.79-0.93) and proctitis/hemorrhage (HR 0.78; 95\%
              CI, 0.64-0.95). IMRT was not associated with rates of composite
              urinary complications (HR 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.83-1.04) or
              cystitis/hematuria (HR 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.83-1.07). The incidence
              of erectile complications involving invasive procedures was low
              and did not differ significantly between groups, although IMRT
              was associated with an increase in new diagnoses of impotence (HR
              1.27, 95\% CI, 1.14-1.42). CONCLUSION: IMRT is associated with a
              small reduction in composite bowel complications and

              DESIGN AND SETTING: The algorithm training and validation sets
              were based on data from 2000 and 2001, respectively. The
              validation was carried out at an individual level by linkage of
              cases identified by the algorithm with cases in the Piedmont
              Cancer Registry diagnosed in 2001. RESULTS: The sensitivity of
              the algorithm was higher for lung cancer (80.8\%) than for breast
              (76.7\%) and colorectal (72.4\%) cancers. The positive predictive
              values were 78.7\%, 87.9\%, and 92.6\% for lung, colorectal, and
              breast cancer, respectively. The high values for colorectal and
              breast cancers were due to the model's ability to distinguish
              prevalent from incident cases and to the accuracy of surgery
              claims for case identification. CONCLUSIONS: Given its moderate
              sensitivity, this algorithm is not intended to replace cancer
              registration, but it is a valuable tool to investigate other
              aspects of cancer surveillance. This method provides a valid

              outcomes after stroke. However, the burden of acute kidney injury
              after stroke has not been extensively investigated. METHODS: We
              used MEDLINE and Embase to conduct a systematic review and
              meta-analysis of published studies that provided data on the risk
              of AKI and outcomes in adults after ischemic and hemorrhagic
              stroke. Pooled incidence was examined using the Stuart-Ord method
              in a DerSimonian-Laird model. Pooled Odds Ratios and 95\%
              confidence intervals were calculated for outcomes using a random
              effects model. This review was registered with PROSPERO
              (CRD42017064588). RESULTS: Eight studies were included, five from
              the United States, representing 99.9\% of included patients.
              Three studies used established acute kidney injury criteria based
              on creatinine values to define acute kidney injury and five used
              International Classification of Diseases coding definitions.
              Overall pooled incidence was 9.61\% (95\% confidence interval
              8.33-10.98). Incidence for studies using creatinine definitions
              was 19.51\% (95\% confidence interval 12.75-27.32\%) and for
              studies using coding definitions 4.63\% (95\% confidence interval
              3.65-5.72\%). Heterogeneity was high throughout. Mortality in
              stroke patients who sustained acute kidney injury was increased
              (Odds Ratio 2.45; 95\% confidence interval 1.47-4.10). Three
              studies reported risk factors for acute kidney injury. There was
              sparse information on other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality in
              stroke patients who develop acute kidney injury is significantly
              increased. However the reported incidence of AKI after stroke
              varies widely and is underestimated using coding definitions.

              preventable factors to reduce acute kidney injury after stroke

              of the English language literature were performed to identify
              studies published between 1990 and 2010 that evaluated the

              investigators independently reviewed the abstracts and articles

              criteria. RESULTS: A total of 35 articles met the criteria for
              evaluation. Of these, 26 articles provided data to evaluate the
              validity of stroke, seven reported the validity of TIA, five
              reported the validity of intracranial bleeds (intracerebral

              administrative and claims data differ greatly in the published

              administrative databases for identification of cases of serious
              myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We
              conducted a retrospective study among patients enrolled in 11
              geographically dispersed managed care organizations. Cohorts of
              new users of specific statins and fibrates were identified by
              selecting patients with an initial dispensing of the drug during
              the period 1 January 1998 to 30 June 2001. Potential cases of
              serious myopathy or rhabdomyolysis were identified using specific
              criteria based upon ICD-9-CM codes suggesting a muscle disorder
              or acute renal failure. RESULTS: A total of 194 hospitalizations
              meeting the criteria for chart review selection were identified
              among 206,732 new users of statins and 15,485 new users of
              fibrates. Overall, 31 cases of serious, clinically important
              myopathy or rhabdomyolysis (18\%) were confirmed through chart
              review. Of these, 26 (84\%) had a claim including codes for
              myoglobinuria (ICD-9-CM 791.3) or other disorders of muscle,
              ligament, and fascia (ICD-9-CM 728.89). A PPV of 74\% (26 of 35

              muscle'' accompanied by a claim for a CK test within 7 days of
              hospitalization or a discharge code for acute renal failure.
              CONCLUSION: For rare adverse events such as serious myopathy or

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Long-term cognitive impairment is a common and important
              problem in survivors of critical illness. We developed electronic
              search algorithms to identify cognitive impairment and dementia
              from the electronic medical records (EMRs) that provide
              opportunity for big data analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
              Eligible patients met 2 criteria. First, they had a formal
              cognitive evaluation by The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. Second,
              they were hospitalized in intensive care unit at our institution
              between 2006 and 2014. The ``criterion standard'' for diagnosis
              was formal cognitive evaluation supplemented by input from an
              expert neurologist. Using all available EMR data, we developed
              and improved our algorithms in the derivation cohort and
              validated them in the independent validation cohort. RESULTS: Of
              993 participants who underwent formal cognitive testing and were
              hospitalized in intensive care unit, we selected 151 participants
              at random to form the derivation and validation cohorts. The
              automated electronic search algorithm for cognitive impairment
              was 94.3\% sensitive and 93.0\% specific. The search algorithms
              for dementia achieved respective sensitivity and specificity of
              97\% and 99\%. EMR search algorithms significantly outperformed
              International Classification of Diseases codes. CONCLUSIONS:
              Automated EMR data extractions for cognitive impairment and
              dementia are reliable and accurate and can serve as acceptable
              and efficient alternatives to time-consuming manual data review.",

              assessment of thromboembolic adverse event risk following
              treatment with intravenous immune globulin, charts were obtained
              for 103 potential post-intravenous immune globulin AMI cases.
              Charts were abstracted by trained nurses and
              physician-adjudicated based on prespecified diagnostic criteria.
              RESULTS: Acute myocardial infarction status could be determined
              for 89 potential cases. The PPVs for the inpatient AMI diagnoses
              recorded in the SDD were 75\% overall (95\% CI, 65-84\%), 93\%

              against the provincial hospital and physician administrative

              definitions were depressive disorder diagnoses (either in

              electronic medical records is an important initial step in

              validation is time-consuming and cumbersome. We compared
              different approaches to develop an automatic case identification
              system with high sensitivity to assist manual annotators.
              METHODS: We used four different machine-learning algorithms to
              build case identification systems for two data sets, one
              comprising hepatobiliary disease patients, the other acute renal
              failure patients. To improve the sensitivity of the systems, we
              varied the imbalance ratio between positive cases and negative
              cases using under- and over-sampling techniques, and applied
              cost-sensitive learning with various misclassification costs.
              RESULTS: For the hepatobiliary data set, we obtained a high
              sensitivity of 0.95 (on a par with manual annotators, as compared
              to 0.91 for a baseline classifier) with specificity 0.56. For the
              acute renal failure data set, sensitivity increased from 0.69 to
              0.89, with specificity 0.59. Performance differences between the
              various machine-learning algorithms were not large. Classifiers
              performed best when trained on data sets with imbalance ratio
              below 10. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to achieve high sensitivity
              with moderate specificity for automatic case identification on
              two data sets of electronic medical records. Such a

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: An electronic healthcare record (EHR) system, when
              used by healthcare providers, improves the quality of care for
              patients and helps to lower costs. Information collected from
              manual or electronic health records can also be used for purposes
              not directly related to patient care delivery, in which case it
              is termed secondary use. EHR systems facilitate the collection of
              this secondary use data, which can be used for research purposes
              like observational studies, taking advantage of improvement in
              the structuring and retrieval of patient information. However,
              some of the following problems are common when conducting a
              research using this kind of data: (i) Over time, systems and data
              storage methods become obsolete; (ii) Data concerns arise since
              the data is being used in a context removed from its original
              intention; (iii) There are privacy concerns when sharing data
              about individual subjects; (iv) The partial availability of
              standard medical vocabularies and natural language processing
              tools for non-English language limits information extraction from
              structured and unstructured data in the EHR systems. A systematic
              approach is therefore needed to overcome these, where local data
              processing is performed prior to data sharing. METHOD: The
              proposed study describes a local processing method to extract
              cohorts of patients for observational studies in four steps: (1)
              data reorganization from an existing local logical schema into a
              common external schema over which information can be extracted;
              (2) cleaning of data, generation of the database profile and
              retrieval of indicators; (3) computation of derived variables
              from original variables; (4) application of study design
              parameters to transform longitudinal data into anonymized data
              sets ready for statistical analysis and sharing. Mapping from the
              local logical schema into a common external schema must be
              performed differently for each EHR and is not subject of this
              work, but step 2, 3 and 4 are common to all EHRs. The external
              schema accepts parameters that facilitate the extraction of
              different cohorts for different studies without having to change
              the extraction algorithms, and ensures that, given an immutable
              data set, can be done by the idempotent process. Statistical
              analysis is part of the process to generate the results necessary
              for inclusion in reports. The generation of indicators to
              describe the database allows description of its characteristics,
              highlighting study results. The set extraction/statistical
              processing is available in a version controlled repository and
              can be used at any time to reproduce results, allowing the
              verification of alterations and error corrections. This
              methodology promotes the development of reproducible studies and
              allows potential research problems to be tracked upon extraction
              algorithms and statistical methods RESULTS: This method was
              applied to an admissions database, SI(3), from the InCor-HCFMUSP,
              a tertiary referral hospital for cardiovascular disease in the
              city of Sao Paulo, as a source of secondary data with 1116848
              patients records from 1999 up to 2013. The cleaning process
              resulted in 313894 patients records and 27698 patients in the
              cohort selection, with the following criteria: study period:

              carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer in three Italian
              administrative databases. DESIGN: A diagnostic accuracy study
              comparing ICD-9-CM codes for carcinoma in situ (233.0) and for
              invasive breast cancer (174.x) with medical chart (as a reference
              standard). Case definition: (1) presence of a primary nodular
              lesion in the breast and (2) cytological or histological
              documentation of cancer from a primary or metastatic site.
              SETTING: Administrative databases from Umbria Region, Azienda

              position) between 2012 and 2014. OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity
              and specificity for codes 233.0 and 174.x. RESULTS: For invasive
              breast cancer the sensitivities were 98\% (95\% CI 93\% to 99\%)
              for Umbria, 96\% (95\% CI 91\% to 99\%) for NA and 100\% (95\% CI
              97\% to 100\%) for FVG. Specificities were 90\% (95\% CI 82\% to
              95\%) for Umbria, 91\% (95\% CI 83\% to 96\%) for NA and 91\%
              (95\% CI 84\% to 96\%) for FVG.For carcinoma in situ the
              sensitivities were 100\% (95\% CI 93\% to 100\%) for Umbria,
              100\% (95\% CI 95\% to 100\%) for NA and 100\% (95\% CI 96\% to
              100\%) for FVG. Specificities were 98\% (95\% CI 93\% to 100\%)

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Administrative healthcare databases are useful
              tools to study healthcare outcomes and to monitor the health
              status of a population. Patients with cancer can be identified
              through disease-specific codes, prescriptions and physician
              claims, but prior validation is required to achieve an accurate
              case definition. The objective of this protocol is to assess the
              accuracy of International Classification of Diseases Ninth
              Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for breast, lung
              and colorectal cancers in identifying patients diagnosed with the
              relative disease in three Italian administrative databases.
              METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Data from the administrative databases of
              Umbria Region (910,000 residents), Local Health Unit 3 of Napoli
              (1,170,000 residents) and Friuli--Venezia Giulia Region
              (1,227,000 residents) will be considered. In each administrative
              database, patients with the first occurrence of diagnosis of
              breast, lung or colorectal cancer between 2012 and 2014 will be
              identified using the following groups of ICD-9-CM codes in
              primary position: (1) 233.0 and (2) 174.x for breast cancer; (3)
              162.x for lung cancer; (4) 153.x for colon cancer and (5)
              154.0-154.1 and 154.8 for rectal cancer. Only incident cases will
              be considered, that is, excluding cases that have the same
              diagnosis in the 5 years (2007-2011) before the period of
              interest. A random sample of cases and non-cases will be selected
              from each administrative database and the corresponding medical
              charts will be assessed for validation by pairs of trained,
              independent reviewers. Case ascertainment within the medical
              charts will be based on (1) the presence of a primary nodular
              lesion in the breast, lung or colon-rectum, documented with
              imaging or endoscopy and (2) a cytological or histological
              documentation of cancer from a primary or metastatic site.
              Sensitivity and specificity with 95\% CIs will be calculated.
              DISSEMINATION: Study results will be disseminated widely through
              peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national and
              international conferences.",

              revision codes. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE,
              EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library (April 2017).
              ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: The inclusion criteria were: (a) the
              presence of a reference standard; (b) the presence of at least
              one accuracy test measure (eg, sensitivity) and (c) the use of an
              administrative database. DATA EXTRACTION: Eligible studies were
              selected and data extracted independently by two reviewers;
              quality was assessed using the Standards for Reporting of
              Diagnostic accuracy criteria. DATA ANALYSIS: Extracted data were
              synthesised using a narrative approach. RESULTS: From 2929
              records screened 21 studies were included (data collection period
              between 1977 and 2011). Eighteen studies evaluated ICD-9 codes
              (11 of which assessed both invasive breast cancer (code 174.x)
              and carcinoma in situ (ICD-9 233.0)); three studies evaluated
              invasive breast cancer-related ICD-10 codes. All studies except
              one considered incident cases.The initial algorithm results were:
              sensitivity >/=80\% in 11 of 17 studies (range 57\%-99\%);
              positive predictive value was >/=83\% in 14 of 19 studies (range
              15\%-98\%) and specificity >/=98\% in 8 studies. The combination
              of the breast cancer diagnosis with surgical procedures,
              chemoradiation or radiation therapy, outpatient data or physician
              claim may enhance the accuracy of the algorithms in some but not
              all circumstances. Accuracy for breast cancer based on outpatient
              or physician's data only or breast cancer diagnosis in secondary
              position diagnosis resulted low. CONCLUSION: Based on the
              retrieved evidence, administrative databases can be employed to
              identify primary breast cancer. The best algorithm suggested is
              ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes located in primary position. TRIAL

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Clinical trials and few observational studies report
              increased hyperkalemia risks in heart failure patients receiving
              aldosterone blockers in addition to standard therapy. The aim of
              this study is to assess the hyperkalemia risk and combined use of
              spironolactone and long-term ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme)
              inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy for heart
              failure in a real-life setting of a heterogeneous population.
              METHODS: Using claims data of the statutory health insurance fund
              AOK, covering 30\% of the German population, we performed a
              nested case-control study in a cohort of heart failure patients
              receiving continuous ACE/ARB therapy (n = 1,491,894).
              Hyperkalemia risk associated with concurrent use of
              spironolactone and ACE/ARB was calculated by conditional logistic
              regression in 1062 cases and 10,620 risk-set-sampling-matched
              controls. RESULTS: Risk of hyperkalemia in heart failure patients
              was significantly associated with spironolactone use (odds ratio
              (OR) (95\% confidence interval (CI)) = 13.59 (11.63-15.88) in all
              and 11.05 (8.67-14.08) in those with information on New York
              Heart Association (NYHA) stage of disease). In the NYHA
              subpopulation, higher risk estimates were observed in short-term
              as compared with long-term users (OR (95\%CI) = 13.00
              (9.82-17.21) and 9.12 (6.78-12.26), respectively). Moreover, the
              association was stronger in older (>/=70 years of age) as
              compared with younger patients (<70 years of age) (OR (95\%CI) =
              12.32 (9.35-16.23) and 8.73 (5.05-15.08), respectively), although
              interaction was not significant (pinteraction = 0.07).
              CONCLUSIONS: Hyperkalemia risk associated with combined use of
              spironolactone and ACE/ARB is much stronger in real-life practice
              than observed in clinical trials. Careful potassium level
