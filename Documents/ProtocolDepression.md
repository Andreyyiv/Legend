# Rationale and Background

The Large-scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation in a Network of Databases (LEGEND) project aims to generate reliable evidence on the effects of medical interventions using observational healthcare data to support clinical decision making. LEGEND follows ten guiding principles (see Supplementary Material); chief among these stand that we generate evidence at large-scale to achieve completeness and facilitate analysis of the overall distribution of effect size estimates across treatments and outcomes.  We also generate evidence consistently by applying a systematic approach across all research questions and disseminate evidence regardless on the estimates effects to avoid publication bias. These aims help overcome the questionable reliable of observational research @Schuemie2018.
